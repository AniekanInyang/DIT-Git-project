1,"What does it mean to be successful? Perhaps, owning your own home, launching a million-dollar business, having the perfect relationship or simply just being happy with yourself. Success comes in many forms and could be simply achieved by setting goals and following through with them.
It is true that success takes effort and dedication. If you&rsquo;re looking to find success in your life, here are some specific habits most successful women follow on a daily basis. They are habits that can be picked up by anyone looking to achieve success in their personal and professional lives.

She educates herself

Education does not necessarily mean academic knowledge. It could be practical knowledge, asking questions and finding answers to them. Reading is a very essential element of success. It&rsquo;s simply taking a few hours of the day to read and expand knowledge.
A successful woman understands the importance of educating herself, in order to become well versed in different aspects of life.

She challenges herself

A successful woman continually pushes herself. She has very high standards so she moves out of her comfort zone and aims for the unachievable.
In the process of challenging herself, she becomes aware of qualities she didn&rsquo;t know she possessed and thereby becomes a better person. 

She makes her health a priority

Being healthy is a state of mind. It&rsquo;s not just about going to the gym or being mindful of her food intake. It encompasses the well being of her physical and mental body.
Being healthy ensures a productive day, so she eats right and adopts a healthy coping mechanism in order to stay stress-free and maintain her energy.

She stays socially connected

A successful woman understands that work isn&rsquo;t everything. She is able to balance her personal and professional life. She can step away from work and enjoy herself. She can hold a glass of wine and also maintain a meaningful conversation.
Being successful doesn&rsquo;t require her cutting herself from other people. Friends and family are equally important as they keep her on track in life.

She sets goals and follows through

She might not instantly know how to get to where she wants to be, but she definitely knows what she wants to be. Setting goals helps her achieve that. She puts into place an action plan in order to achieve those goals.
She creates goals around every aspect of her life from her career, through to her health and her personal relationships.

2,"Much has been made of Africa&rsquo;s unfavorable geography, including its distance from leading markets, the number of land-locked countries, low population density and unfavorable climatic conditions.
However the private sector and market driven interventions will definitely play a key role in the economic development of the African continent. The traditional private sector intervention on the other hand has played a significant role in the development in Africa especially where the business models allows for benefit sharing with other stakeholders.
The matter is, however, complicated when it relates to provision of social or public good. In most instances the citizens&rsquo; as well as the private sector has expected this to be provided by the government. Unfortunately, this has not been the case due to limited resources.
To bridge the gap, the emergence of social/mission-driven enterprises has been on the rise and have a huge potential in moving developing countries to development and at the same time solving some challenges being faced by such developing countries.
There has been a global movement towards impact investing which is giving rise to social enterprises aimed at solving the challenges that will have been resolved by government on market-based approach. Impact investing in Africa remains dormant and has the potential to resolve the African challenges especially in health, education, introduction of renewable energy systems among other factors and at the same time contribute to the continent&rsquo;s economic growth and respective development objectives. This will be going a long way in replacing official development assistance (ODA) which has predominately been the source of development finance in the continent.

Investors will play a larger role where it will be used to improve access to social services in Africa.
In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the private financial flows to Africa as the traditional ODA declines. This will mean that there is need for the African Governments to provide the relevant space to attract even more investors and especially where those funds will be able to provide for the public goods in a market-based approach.
This will, in turn, be of help in addressing the socio-economic challenges by providing market-based solutions that address the priority areas such as health, education, water and energy supplies among others.
Now and in the future Africa, long dependent on aid, will instead rely on investment to fuel its growth. Rapid growth is expected, because of the rise of the middle class, stable governments, urbanization, and improved infrastructure.
We hoping 2019 will present a good year for the continent to encourage more social enterprises and mission driven investment with the aim of resolving some of the challenges that the continent is faced with in a more market-based way. This call innovations in various sectors such as technology, finance, agriculture, health etc be put in place.

3,"A few days after a Damaris Wambui Kamau and her son Dennis Ngaruiya rejected a presidential gift of a house new allegations have emerged. The house which sits on a plot of land in Nakuru county is said to have been procured bya well wisher who has since not been named.

The rift valley regionalcommissioner Chimwaga Mongo has come out with claims that the president did not promise the woman any house. He insisted that the only promise that was made was that of paying school fees for Ngaruiya which has been done without hitches. Last week Damaris wambui made headlines after rejecting the gift claiming that it was substandard and that it was not what the president had promised or rather it did not meet presidential standards. She further claimed that the house was not a new one and had been used by a disabled man who died recently.
The house which sits on a piece of land next to that of one of state house workers has elicited different reactions from Kenyans on social media.
Some Kenyans have termed the woman as ungrateful while others have applauded her for not accepting to settle for what they term as mediocrity. The house has now been handed over to what the regional commissioner termed as a more deserving Kenyan.

Mr. Macharia Gachie a 58 year old father of six is the new lucky occupant of the two bed roomed house. He was selected from three other deserving Kenyans whose names were fronted. This was done after what is said to have been &ldquo;orders from above&rdquo; to give the house to a more deserving Kenyan.
Mr Gachie who has three disabled kids thanked well wishers for the new house. The house and the land are estimated to have cost 1 million shillings.
Ms. Kamau on the other hand claimed that she had no regrets and that she had made her point and that the president will know the truth soon.

Just a few hours after their release on a shs 200,000 bond each, the seven suspects who were arrested on claim that they had duped Nairobi Businessman 10 million shillings are under investigation this time for fake currency related allegations. This comes after police impounded billions of shillings in fake currency stashed in boxes. The currency was impounded in a house linked to the suspects in Ruiru Kiambu county.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve managed to get Sh32.6 billion &mdash; $324million, 1 million sterling pounds, 840 million euros and one million Kenya shillings,&rdquo; Ruiru police boss James Ng&rsquo;etich said.
Ruiru police boss James Ng&rsquo;etich said the cash was stashed in iron boxes. The suspects were identified as Joseph Munyao and Nancy Muthoni.
The 26 pieces of fake gold were recovered from Muthoni&rsquo;s handbag. Munyao had a pistol for which he had a licence.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll subject it to further scrutiny with the relevant authorities to ascertain its authenticity,&rdquo; Ng&rsquo;etich said. &ldquo;These are people engaging in money laundering. They will assist us in our investigations so we can break the syndicate, which we believe is big.&rdquo;
In the earlier scandal the 7 were accused of impersonating the President and calling a Nairobi BuSiness man who heads the Sameer group. Mr Meralli who is the Sameer boss is said to have been duped into believing that the call was from President Kenyatta. The conman claimed that he needed the business man to pay 10million facilitation fee for a peace of land which statehouse would subsequently assist in purchasing.

A milimani court was told that Mr Meralli who was not in the country at the time directed the Sameer Finance Director Akif Hamid to process the transaction.
The key suspect Joseph Munyao has in the past come under police scrutiny to murder related cases. He has also been under Media focus especially after arriving for a past court case in a convoy of high-end guzzlers with over seven body guards.
The flying squad pounced on them in search for guns but did not find any. In Another instance he caused a stir at Kitui when he went to visit his fiancee with four choppers. The bent was attended by Emabakasi East legislator Babu Owino who has since distanced himself claiming that he was invited by a local MP. The extravagant lifestyle of the suspect is under scrutiny even as police continue with investigations into the recent allegations."
5,"IPOA is investigating the murder of four people on Tuesday night. Among the four was a lawyer. Following the murder of the advocate identified as Jeremiah Kinyua Meeme, The Law Society Of Kenya has written to the director of public prosecutions and the deputy inspector general of police demanding answers on the crime. They have asked that arrests and prosecutions be made.
The killing happened in Juja after confrontations between the four and the police, after which the police claimed the four were robbers who opened fire first. Police sprayed their car with 40 bullets and claim that they were 5 but one escaped. According to the police the five intended to rob Lexo petrol station in Juja.
It is also alleged that the one who escaped had an AK47 which prompted them to shoot the rest who it is also claimed had pistols. IPOA is said to be investigating the matter with an aim of unraveling the whole situation.
They have promised that if found guilty action will be taken against the officers.
The bodies were taken to city mortuary and autopsies conducted. One body is however yet to be claimed.
The family of the lawyer maintains that he was not a criminal while LSK president said that this was the greatest threat to the rule of law especially when defenders of the same law are under threat.

1436,"Former President Jerry John Rawlings has called for an urgent review of the Fourth Republican Constitution to remove the entrenched clauses that protect high-level political actors and embolden some of them to abuse their office and criminally profit from their positions during the June 4th address.  Delivering the keynote address at a parade, wreath-laying ceremony and durbar to climax the activities marking the 40th-anniversary of the June 4 uprising at Nungua on Tuesday, the architect of the uprising said there are many constitutional clauses that do not serve our interest and called for an urgent establishment of a constituent assembly to review them.  &ldquo;Over the years, the indemnity clauses have emboldened certain characters to abuse their offices and profit themselves. The Constitution of the Fourth Republic was created by us, for us and to serve us, and in light of the 25 years, there is an unqualified need to reform or rewrite our current constitution. An urgent constituent assembly ought to be established with the necessary powers to rewrite the constitution,&rdquo;  Flt Lt Rawlings said problematic clauses such as the transitional provisions and the indemnity clauses need to be reviewed to ensure that everyone is equal before the law to encourage transparency, accountability and responsible governance.  At the heavily-attended durbar, the Chairman of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), Chairman of the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) and first President of the Fourth Republic said the key to Ghana&rsquo;s development is heightened self-discipline in all we do.  He said: &ldquo;Our current sense of self-discipline is at its lowest ebb. Citizens do not feel responsible enough to keep their homes and communities clean. Many of us who lament about flooding during the rainy season are very guilty of the indiscretions that lead to the deadly floods. We dump refuse indiscriminately and wonder why drains choke. Some actually see the rains as an opportunity to dump refuse, believing the rainwater will sweep them away. If we continue this level of lawlessness, we are bound to face more serious flood disasters.  &ldquo;Let us all do a thorough introspection and identify where we fall short because we all do fall short one way or the other,&rdquo; Flt Lt Rawlings urged.  Recounting circumstances surrounding June 4 1979 and December 31, 1981, the former President said the explosion of June 4 could have taken place on May 15 of the same year had the charge in the atmosphere been ignited anywhere before midnight that day.  In like manner, Flt Lt Rawlings said, had those who climbed the seat of power three months later learnt the lessons of June 4, 31st December 1981 could have been avoided.  He said right after the PNP government came into office, those in authority proceeded to devalue the essence of the uprising by luring AFRC members out of the country, forgetting that most of the genuine, unrewarded and unrecognised leaders were still on the ground.  The intention of the authorities the former president disclosed, was to intimidate, harass, arrest and persecute some of them. The motive of these actions was to re-terrorise our people back into subordination and submissiveness; in short, to re-govern the people with the fear factor.  &ldquo;Instead of the then government taking up the challenge to lead a nation that was pumped up and ready to continue to rectify the rot, of the past, to defy any obstacle and to solidify the unity and purposefulness of our nation, the reverse is what occurred. This heightened the fever for June 4th,&rdquo; the leader of the 31st December Revolution stated.  Former President Rawlings said humanity has always been defined by its freedom and justice. He said while humanity all over the world has faced revolts and revolutions resulting in public executions of the royal families in France and Russia for instance &ldquo;some of us still have difficulties learning about the basic fundamentals of freedom, justice and democracy in governance.  The former President did not spare Alhaji Yusif Ibrahim who at a recent book launch said he had forgiven the former for the demolition of his hotel in 1999. He said Alhaji Yusif was in no position to forgive anyone or anything stating that he would do it again and again and take along new gargantuan structures built on waterways.  God, Mr. Rawlings said had nothing to do with unlawful structures.  He described the allegation that he ordered the demolition because Alhaji Yusif was Sam Jonah&rsquo;s friend as laughable. He said Jonah had a bigger appetite than &ldquo;your little hotel&rdquo;.  The founder of the NDC entreated all Ghanaians to remember the discipline that characterised June 4th and replicate that everywhere.  He said, &ldquo;If we do not develop a national character for sustainable good governance, we would have failed this generation and especially generations yet to come. Is that the legacy we wish to bequeath the future?  Other speakers at the event where Alhaji Huudu Yahaya, Johnson Asiedu Nketia, Dr Zanetor Agyeman-Rawlings and Edem Agbana.  Earlier the former President had reviewed the parade and helped to light the perpetual flame in memory of the fallen heroes.

6,"David L. Poulson who served in Erie in North Pennsylvania as a priest has been deflected by the Vatican. He was among 300 priests from the state who has been accused of sex related crimes since 1947. Of the 300, only two were charged. The grand jury argued that the other cases were above the statute of limitations.
In October Poulson pleaded guilty to two charges of felony which includes corruption of minors and Endangering child welfare. In his plea, Poulson sought for laicization which is basically being removed from priesthood. The request was approved by pope Francis.
Poulson who had served the Catholic church for a period of 4 decades was sentenced to between 2.5 and 14 years in a Pennsylvania prison. He has now been cancelled from the clerical state and cannot conduct any priest related roles including administering of the holy communion."
7,"In what started as a campaign strategy to a promising positive paradigm shift towards elevating the digital standards among young kids joining primary school, the whole idea seems to have hit a dead end. It started out with the promise of each pupil joining class one receiving a laptop, however, in the initial stages of the roll out things started going south.
First it was the challenge of electricity connectivity, and then followed the issue of teachers not being ready, to finally rolling out tablets instead of the promised laptops.

In what looks like an entirely new plan, the ministry of education through its principal secretary Belio Kipsang has come out has come out to state that the government will build computer laboratories in each of the 25,000 public schools.
This will come as a substitution to the failed one pupil one laptop policy. Speaking during the presentation of budgetary proposals to the Parliamentary Education Committee, DR. Kipsang said that the new move will bring about ICT integration.
He also said that the construction of the laboratories was part of the initial plan but was intended to be the second phase."

The fight for positions in post-President Uhuru Kenyatta government has intensified, with politicians pushing for a referendum to expand the Executive. Pundits, politicians and civil society groups say the referendum push is part of the wider scheme for top politicians to remain relevant post-2022, and to have an influence in the next government.&ldquo;A nation of contradictions! We applaud plans to amend the Constitution to accommodate presidential election losers in the Executive but fight the appointment of other election losers to state corporations,&rdquo; former Mandera Senator Billow Kerrow said.&ldquo;Being penny wise and pound foolish, to say the least.&rdquo;Those who have already shown their interest for the country&rsquo;s top seat in the coming polls are Deputy president William Ruto, Nasa founder and ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya&rsquo;s Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula. Although opposition leader Raila Odinga has not publicly said he will be on the ballot, it is widely seen that we will still vie.Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka, who previously said he would not play second fiddle to anyone else after 2017 polls on Tuesday appeared to make an about-turn when he said he would take the position of Deputy Prime Minister if the constitutional changes go through, and Uhuru takes the position of Prime Minister.&ldquo;If by any chance Wiper, ANC, ODM, Jubilee and Ford-Kenya merge, and I find myself contesting for position of PM with my brother Uhuru, then I would rather step down and support his bid,"" Kalonzo said.International Centre for Policy and Conflict executive director Ndung&rsquo;u Wainaina said, &ldquo;They are amending the Constitution to create a formula for all them to be in government.&rdquo;And Kalonzo fell short of confirming that when he told Citizen TV that post-2022, &ldquo; you have to envision a situation where there will be an attempt to have a government of national unity, and in that government, I don&rsquo;t see a way where you can write off President Uhuru Kenyatta.He said he was preparing Kenyans for what might happen ahead.Uhuru&rsquo;s allies ignited the debate on the role of Uhuru after his two-term constitutional tenure, some saying he was too young to leave the government.&ldquo;Let us support the constitutional amendment so that we can have a Constitution that is accommodative,&rdquo; Cotu Secretary general Francis Atwoli said at a past Makadara Day event.Though many masquerade as presidential candidates or announce their bids in general elections it is a move meant to build politicians&rsquo; national profile as well as leverage their negotiation in political alliances expecting to form a new government.Behind the scenes, some politicians want to use the presidential race to negotiate for a stake in post-Uhuru era.&ldquo;It is an intricate of political game involving different players. Although some are real, others are balloons being thrown in air for distraction and do tests,&rdquo; Ndung&rsquo;u said.He said politicians fight to remain in government since it&rsquo;s the most lucrative and machinery for extracting personal wealth.&ldquo;Most of the richest persons in Kenya were either top politicians, top civil servants, bureaucrats and or to securocrats. Simply, the government is road to personal wealth without sweat,&rdquo; he said.

Mr. Njoroge has been accused by the parliamentarians for running the banking sector unconstitutionally. According to the finance act the governor is supposed to bring regulations for approval to the national assembly, instead Mr Njoroge has been accused of using circulars and memos to run the banking sector.

MPs cited that its becoming hard for Kenyans to transact amounts above 1 million without raising eyebrows. Majority leader Aden Duale accused the CBK boss of turning banks into documentation bureaus. He also stated that this regulations should not make it hard for Kenyans transacting genuine business to operate.

This comes even as MPS prepare to have a session with him on Tuesday to answer questions regarding the status of the CBK regulations and why he doesn't honor the invitations of the national assembly planning and finance committee."
1437,"The Data Protection Commission will soon probe the Electoral Commission (EC) for selling electoral data to a software development company.
In an interview with the media, Executive Director of the Data Protection Commission, Patricia Odusei-Poku said the issues revealed by the Auditor General's report will be treated with utmost seriousness.
&ldquo;If indeed information has been sold, then that&rsquo;s definitely a breach and we are definitely looking into it. If there has been a sale of personal data with evidence that is clear in this report then we will follow due process,&rdquo; she said. She said all stakeholders in the alleged breach will be assessed and audited.
Auditor-General&rsquo;s report
A special audit carried out by the Auditor-General on the EC has revealed the Commission sold voters&rsquo; data to an Accra-based software development company, Bysystem Ltd.
According to the 2018 audit, Bysystem Ltd bought the data from the EC and further sold them to financial service providers for a fee.
The audit report also found fault with a lack of contractual agreement to cover the deal between the EC and Bysystem Ltd in breach of procurement laws.
&ldquo;We further noted that Bysystem Ltd. failed to remit the 20% commission due the Electoral Commission, in respect of charges for accessing the data, for the 2016 and 2017 financial years,&rdquo; the audit report stated.
The EC, according to the report, responded to the findings and stated that &ldquo;there exists a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the commission and Bysystem Limited.&rdquo;
The EC also said it suspended the MoU in the third quarter of 2016 and that prior to the suspension, the software development company had made a payment for the first and second quarters in 2016.
However, the Auditor-General, after reviewing the MoU, said it did not constitute a Service Level Agreement.
Furthermore, the report revealed that the basis of the 20% commission is not stated in the MoU.
Also, the Auditor-General said there was no evidence of the suspension of the MoU as stated by management in their response.
Recommendation
The Auditor-General has since recommended that the EC make available the contract agreement on the arrangement, if any, and recover all outstanding commission due to the Electoral Commission within 30 days from the receipt of the management letter.
It warned that failure to do so means the contract shall be abrogated and the approving and authorising officers surcharged."
13,"Following the tragic terror attack in Newzealand one suspect has been arrested and charged with one count of murder. The suspect, Brenton Tarrant is of Australian origin. He is said to have been a frequent traveller with most of his visits being to Turkey, Pakistan and Bulgaria.
In the Friday Morning attack 50 people were killed while 50 others sustained serious injuries. This is according to Mike Bush the Newzealand police commissioner. The suspect was remanded and authorities say that he will face more charges. 
According to his former neighbours, Tarrant was a relatively normal person. Authorities have also confirmed that he had no criminal records both in Newzealand and Australia. He worked at Big River Squash and Fitness Centre. The Gym manager Tracey Gray described him as a normal man with no signs of extremism or crazy behaviour. 
Tarrant&rsquo;s family whose father died in 2004 is assisting with investigations. Christchurch mayor Lianne Dalziel has stated that the suspect targeted Newzealand for its reputation of being a safe haven. The guns used during the attack were acquired legally. 
One of them has been modified though. Newzealand prime minister has vowed to amend the countries gun ownership laws to make them more stringent.

14,"Another corruption scandal involving the government has been unearthed by detectives. The scandal revolving around the construction of 3 dams will set back the taxpayer 91 billion which was the cost of the entire project. 63 billion of the portion has been released but the work has not begun. the dams which were supposed to be constructed in kerio valley were supposed to be funded through a loan which has been guaranteed by the government of Kenya. the financial position of the contractor is under question meaning that should he fail to account for anything then Kenyan Tax payers will have to repay the loan.
A shocking revelation reveals that the CMC Di Ravenna, which was tasked with the job did not enter into any contract with Kenyan agencies meaning that there is no contractual obligation that they should meet. However under unclear circumstances, the various tender documents were signed and delivered by different companies from Italy, south Africa and Kenya. For instance one Paulo Porcelli signed two contracts for the Kimwarer dam and Arror dam costing 38.5 and 28 billion respectively on behalf of CMC Ravenna South Africa. Both Dams were to be constructed in Elgeyo Marakwet.


The south african company was never party to the contract entered between Kerio Valley Development Authority who were the project employers and the contractor. the project was to be undertaken jointly by the Italian company Itinera and CMC from south Africa. legally however, this are two separate entities and none can be extended to the other raising questions on who signed on behalf of the italian contractor.

the duration of the entire project was to be 60 months meaning that they should have been complete by April but nothing has begun yet. Italy's Intensa san paolo and Uni credit are highly linked to the syndicated loan alongside Belgian lender PNB paribas. Proceeds were paid to the contractor after the engineers approval. this raises further questions since such approvals can not be made without certificates of completion which confirm the amount of work done."
15,"On 14th February, 2019, Marek &ldquo;Chinedu&rdquo; Zmylowski put out a very long article titled &ldquo;How Building the Amazon of Africa put me on Interpol Most Wanted List&rdquo;. In the article, he narrated how enroute London from Poland, he was arrested by the Polish border security based on the fact that he was wanted by the Nigeria Government for the crimes of Advanced Financial Fraud. Marek is a Polish entreprener who has built businesses in Africa co-founding &ldquo;Jovago&rdquo; now Jumia Travel and HotelOnline.co among others. 
Apparently, Marek had a business conflict with a Nigerian prominent businessman (the &lsquo;Godfather&rdquo;) who had invested in his startup, &ldquo;HotelOga&rdquo;. This resulted in his name showing up in the passport system as a person wanted by Interpol. His article implied that Interpol was sometimes biased and influenced by amount of &lsquo;donations&rsquo; it received from private institutions in its 190 member countries. After 3 days, he was released because Poland could not extradite its citizen and there was no valid case from Nigeria. He accused the Nigerian Police of being the most corrupt institution in Nigeria, stating Nigeria as the 4th most corrupt country in the world and he claimed to have received a call from the &ldquo;Godfather&rsquo;s&rdquo; lawyer who asked him to pay the sum of 300,000 USD and his issues with the Nigerian Judicial System and Interpol would cease. He strongly refused the offer and it was at that point, Marek decided to fight for justice despite the costs he will incur. 
According to his article, he is not the only victim of the &ldquo;Godfather&rsquo;s&rdquo; usage of &ldquo;political relationships and power&rdquo; to get what he wanted. Marek first sued the Nigerian Police and on July 23rd, 2018 the judge ruled in his favour, due to the Police deciding not to attempt to defend in the court. He was then compensated with 2 million Naira, his initial bank account freeze declared as illegal and the arrest warrant struck down. Unfortunately, after this court ruling, &ldquo;they&rdquo; applied to Interpol Headquarters in Lyon, France and that&rsquo;s why he was put on the wanted list. Marek announced that he has decided to write a book about his story.
Nigerians took this post with mixed reactions. Some people agreed with Marek and also told tales of &ldquo;Godfathers&rdquo; frustrating their business ventures, others asked to hear the other side of the story first while other implied Marek was not a saint and was at fault as well. 
2 days later, in response to Marek&rsquo;s article, Oo Nwoye claimed that Marek allegedly defrauded his investors in Hotel Oga by 

Not disclosing to the investors that there was another entity of the company in Poland
Collecting money on behalf of Nigerian hotels without remitting to them
The company (Polish entity and Nigerian entity) split after some issues between the cofounders
Marek sold the Nigerian entity to a South African company and took all the money received while the Polish entity merged with/was sold to HotelOnline

Due to these, the investors are seeking ways to recover all the money they had invested and are working to rectify their error. It&rsquo;s also suspected that this article Marek has put out (and subsequently, his proposed book) is an attempt to tarnish Nigeria&rsquo;s image as these issues were being settled privately already. 
Nigerian Tech enthusiasts and experts are aggrieved as this might ruin the reputation of the country and industry that many high-flyers are working hard to build. There are many great companies (in tech and other industries) that have foreign investors and co-founders and these companies have not been defrauded. Why then does Marek want to use whatever personal or startup conflicts he has with his investor to paint the Nigerian Tech ecosystem black?
Marek claims he is not attacking Nigeria or the tech ecosystem here but the 'Godfather'. However, his blatant refusal to name this 'Godfather' since he brought the story to the public. This has raised a lot of eyebrows about his intention and credibility of the story. "
16,"The face off began and ended with a 2-0 victory for Arsenal , ending Man United&rsquo;s 12 game winning streak, landing Arsenal 3 points, moving them to 4th place on the table being 2 points ahead of United and 1 point behind Tottenham at 3rd place.
Arsenal begins the first half strong scoring 12 minutes into the match. Granit Xhaka left footed shot from outside the box to the bottom left corner with assistance from Alexandre Lacazette. A goal somewhat suspicious according to the United fans saying that the goal only went in because &lsquo;the wind was on Arsenal&rsquo;s side tonight&rsquo; , lol. 
In the second half Arsenal seem to start of shaky before finding their footing and landing their second goal of the night. Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang steps up to the plate with fans worried and hoping that there wasn&rsquo;t going to be a repeat of the players north London derby miss. Despite missing from the same spot he was in against Tottenham Aubameyang takes the penalty with a right footed shot to the centre of the goal sending the keeper the wrong way. IT&rsquo;S IN. Arsenal 2, Manchester United 0. 
Soon after Arsenal's second goal, a fan ran on to the pitch and shoved United defender Chris Smalling before heading to the Arsenal players. Metropolitan Police reported that a man had been arrested on suspicion of common assault and pitch invasion following an incident that took place during the match and that he was in custody at a north London police station.
Full time Arsenal 2 Man United 0. ""Tottenham Hotspur, we're coming for you"" is all you can hear. Chanting from Arsenal fans filled the Emirates Stadium as Arsenal celebrated their win.
After the game Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang told &lsquo;Sky Sports&rsquo; Jamie Redknapp how he had made sure he didn't make the same mistake saying, ""I was confident, my team-mates give me a lot of confidence. Laca gave me the penalty and that was cool from him, I was really focused. I made a mistake against Tottenham, looking down at the last moment, not watching Lloris, but today I watched until the end - and being focused you score a penalty. I know where the ball is and you have to practice this all the time, and today it went in! I knew that it would be tough, but I was feeling confident and if I missed this one, what can I say?"" He concluded by speaking on behalf of his team saying, ""We have a good spirit, we are hungry. We want to come back into the Champions League and we're all focused on that."" 
The end of the end is the best place to begin. Even though Ole Gunnar Solskj&aelig;r&rsquo;s unbeaten record in the league is over, he acknowledges how his team played and hasn&rsquo;t lost faith as Man Utd prepare to face on Wolves. Ole Gunnar Solskj&aelig;r; &ldquo;We started slow, maybe a backlash from Wednesday night,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We were too slow the first 15 minutes &ndash; he [Xhaka] had time to hit that ball [for the opening goal]. But we created so many chances, so many more than when we beat them in the cup but that doesn&rsquo;t help when the result is like it is. It is not scratching your head, sometimes that happens. We hit the woodwork twice, sometimes strikers take them. I know more than anyone, as a striker, that that can happen. I can&rsquo;t remember any proper saves that David [de Gea] had to make. They didn&rsquo;t really carve us open. It is one of those days, we have to dust ourselves down and now we play Wolves in the FA Cup.&rdquo;

17,"Globalisation is a good thing, they said...! Well, it seems we can't stand each other. Never, there is no space for such assumptions to flourish in our world and it is our responsibility to ensure we can coexist, respecting different values, views and ways of life. Agree to disagree...
First and foremost our thoughts and prayers are with those who lost loved ones in the recent terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand and in other such cowardly acts of violence. A barbaric attack aimed at disrupting peaceful coexistence among communities and spreading senseless hatred...All in the name of immigration and Islamophobia. We live in a globalised and connected world, but it is evident we are more disconnected than ever before. With major divisions in politics, religion, race, our world as we know it is at a major cross roads. We have witnessed racism on the rise in many countries often by prominent people in society and hate speech is common language in many political parties and at times endorsed. We are all citizens of the world, 7.5 Billion people with different races, religions, cultures, languages, but no longer capable of tolerating one another for our uniqueness. The media has a lot to answer for, they have been entrusted to give an unbiased view from around the world but instead tolerate and give attention to Islamophobic, racist, fascist remarks and endorse bigotry. Mainstream media is out of control. 
This is certainly not the first attack on a particular section of society, &lsquo;Chapel Hill shooting and western media bigotry&rsquo; An article headlined in 2015 in &lsquo;Aljazeera&rsquo;. Which goes into detail about how The religious identity of violent perpetrators is only highlighted when they're Muslim. We are witnessing the same in this insistence, the media only interested in the murderers mental state rather than his sadistic beliefs. The &lsquo;Mirror&rsquo; have gone as far to displacing focus from the victims and focusing on &lsquo;Angelic boy&rsquo; gone wrong. Right-wing extremist views have been given a platform around the world and have grown at an alarming rate. The number of terrorist attacks by far-right perpetrators has risen over the past decade. Let's point out some of the major right-wing extremist terror attacks that have occured in the past decade;
In Germany, Marwa El-Sherbini was killed in Dresden&rsquo;s district court on July 1, 2009. She was stabbed by a 28-year-old Russian-German man shortly after testifying against him in a verbal abuse case. He&rsquo;d previously called her a &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Islamist.&rdquo; 
In 2011, a far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik who now goes by the name Fjotolf Hansen, killed 77 people in two terror attacks on July 22, 2011 in Norway. He first set off a bomb in the government district in Oslo before killing young people attending a summer camp on the island of Utoya. Before the attack Breivik had the nerve to publish a manifesto where he decried multiculturalism and the &ldquo;Islamization of Europe.&rdquo;
In 2015 the Chapel Hill shooting, Three university students, Deah Barakat, his wife Yusor Abu-Salha, and her sister Razan Abu-Salha were shot dead by their 46-year-old neighbor on February 10, 2015.
On June 17, 2015, Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston was attacked, a 21-year-old white supremacist, murdered nine African Americans during a prayer service.
On July 22, 2016, a teenager with German-Iranian citizenship shot and killed nine people and wounded more than 15 at a shopping centre in Munich.
On June 19, 2017, a vehicle-ramming attack in Finsbury Park, London, England, killed Makram Ali died and injured nine others when Darren Osborne drove into a crowd of people near a north London mosque.
2 months later on August 12 at the &ldquo;Unite the Right&rdquo; neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville a woman was killed and dozens were wounded when a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of counter protesters.
&ldquo;A terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described an attack on a mosque in Quebec. A gunman opened fire on worshipers at the Islamic Cultural Center in Quebec City in January 2017, killing six people and wounding over a dozen. 
On 27 October 2018, a gunman shouting anti-Semitic slurs opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue, leaving 11 people dead and six others injured. 
New Years day, ""A German man deliberately drove into crowds of people... that were largely made up of foreigners,"" Herbert Reul, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, said. ""There was a clear intention by this man to kill foreigners."" The 50-year-old man carried out targeted attacks on immigrants in the western German cities of Bottrop and Essen injuring eight people. 
Onto the most recent attack Christchurch shootings - ""This is, and will be, one of New Zealand's darkest days,"" an ashen-faced New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told a press conference. With 49 dead and 20 seriously injured, the attack was well planned and coordinated and the perpetrator not known to authorities prior to the attack. One suspect has been charged for murder while a further two men and one women have been arrested in connection with the attack. The attacker wanted to make a statement and he rightly did so by broadcasting the attack live on Facebook and publishing his Manifesto on twitter. One would be mistaken to think it was perhaps a caption from a video game - &lsquo;Call of Duty&rsquo;. However in this instance it was very much real and the call to duty is filled with hate for other humans. What does it take for someone to commit such an inhuman and hideous act then boast about it? That goes for all supporters and offenders of terrorism.
Whether in Europe, America, Australia or New Zealand divisions are being supported from the very top, Brexit and the rise of EDF in the United Kingdom, Similar chaos in most of europe with right wing nationalist parties winning seats in France, Hungry, Germany and the list goes on. The infamous &lsquo;Wall&rsquo; in America and visa bans on people from predominantly muslims countries, the term &lsquo;Shit hole countries&rsquo; famouly coined by Trump has only fueled this type of bigotry... Fraser Anning, an Australian senator blaming the attack in New Zealand on Immigration before being egged by a young bystander - while families are mourning he feels it right to blame the victims. This attack while animalistic, was waiting to happen and I hope it allows us to confront hatred of all kind and realise humanity is at a crossroads. Ha Hellyer in his recent piece in the Guardian sums it up perfectly &lsquo;Anti-Muslim bigotry is a threat to all of us &ndash; we must recognise that before the New Zealand attack is repeated&rsquo;. 
Everyone should be allowed to enjoy the freedoms of life without being judged, discriminated or hated, it is sad to believe in our modern world we are faced with such issues of racism and hate. Whether white or black, Christian, Muslim or Jewish we must coexist. The world is not made for one but for all and we need to learn to accept that we are all different and be prepared to agree to disagree, otherwise we are doomed...

18,"Manchester United were 2-0 down from the first leg but scored after just two minutes. Romelu Lukaku left footed shot from the left side of the six yard box to the bottom right corner. Even though Man United were hanging on for most of the first half but still somehow took a 2-1 lead. 
At the 12 minute mark there&rsquo;s a Goal! Paris Saint Germain 1, Manchester United 1. Juan Bernat left footed shot from the left side of the six yard box to the bottom left corner. Assisted by Kylian Mbapp&eacute;.
Another Goal! Paris Saint Germain 1, Manchester United 2. Romelu Lukaku does it again with a left footed shot from very close range to the centre of the goal.
That&rsquo;s the first half wrapped up, Paris Saint Germain 1, Manchester United 2.
Presnel Kimpembe was penalised for handball in the final minute as referee Damir Skomina ruled he had blocked Diogo Dalot's shot with his arm, and Rashford stepped up to the plate to nail his first penalty for the club home. Marcus Rashford's VAR-awarded stoppage-time penalty fired Manchester United into the Champions League quarter-finals on away goals after a sensational 3-1 victory (3-3 on agg), sealing the deal with one of the most sensational European results in United's history.
According to Pat Nevin, United were a shambles for 35 minutes and they rode their luck, and they grew and grew and grew into the game. There were some performances that were off the scale. We've hardly mentioned Scott McTominay but he was brilliant. His tackling, his bravery, all the way through the game.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer spoke to BT Sport praising his team, ""Fantastic. The belief in the boys was what we hoped for. It was a great start - we planned to get the first goal but we didn't expect it after two minutes. That made it open, we wanted a lot of goals.
""There's always doubt about a penalty, I was in the Champions League with Molde against Basel and my player missed then and we went out. Rashford is 21 and the pressure on the boy - there are no nerves - he's fearless. Him and Romelu were fantastic tonight, summarising the night as a 'A typical United night' ending the conversation by saying, ""There was no need to make speeches after this game.It is an absolutely amazing evening.""
BBC football correspondent John Murray also made a comment saying that, &lsquo;This will very much go onto the list of great comebacks.&rsquo;
For the PSG fans Thiago Silva, Paris St-Germain captain asks for forgiveness saying, ""It's difficult to speak. It's a shame. We played very well over there, but here we didn't do the things we talked about before the game.
""We were on a good run and yet again it ends here. That's football. Nothing worked today. I ask our fans to forgive us.""
United welcome Arsenal in the premier league on Sunday, will they be able to repeat this kind of performace? Lets wait and see.."
19,"Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is preparing to table a huge offer for Paris Saint Germain superstar Neymar this summer, according to Ramon Calderon. A source close to Madrid told SunSport that PSG included a stipulation in the Brazilian&rsquo;s deal that says he can leave for &euro;300m (&pound;263m) on September 1, the day after the transfer window closes. Florentino Perez has had an eye on Neymar for many years, Neymar nearly signed for Madrid prior to signing with Barca. SunSport understands P&eacute;rez is willing to pay a world-record &pound;307 million for the PSG forward. 
But, the question lingering on everyone&rsquo;s mind is whether or not Madrid can gather the funds to finance a world record deal for Neymar. If this deal miraculously falls through according to a Barcelona-based newspaper &lsquo;SPORT&rsquo;, Real Madrid will make Neymar a world-record buy once again, bidding &euro;350m for the 27-year-old. Potentially making him the best paid player on the planet with a salary of &euro;45m (&pound;38.7m).
It is still early to set any predictions, but in football anything is possible. And I am sure Barca fans will not respond well to their former super-star joining arch rivals Real Madrid. If the move is cemented, Neymar will join a few crop of players who have played for both sides. Real Madrid fans will welcome new blood, the club is notoriously known to bring in the best talent and pay big bucks, it's part of the Galactico culture, create the buzz and excitement around a new signing and Neymar will offer them just that. This may be the clubs answer to the recent slump in form, and help create the much needed excitement to spur them into the new season. "
20,"A fan wanted a picture with Ultimate Fighting Championship star Conor McGregor, but according to Miami police the fighter wasn't having it.
The fan, Ahmed Abdirzak and McGregor were leaving the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel which has the well-known nightclub 'Liv' on Monday morning at 5:20 a.m. when the fan tried to take a picture with the fighter with a cell phone, according to a police report. McGregor then slapped the phone out of the fan's hand and stomped on the phone several times.
Police say McGregor picked up the phone and walked away with it. The fan said the phone was valued at $1,000. McGregor was arrested hours later on charges of a second-degree felony, third-degree felony, strong-armed robbery and criminal mischief. 
This isn&rsquo;t the first time the fighter was charged with criminal mischief, just last April McGregor, was charged with attempted assault and criminal mischief after he and others attacked a bus carrying UFC fighters at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The incident left at least two fighters injured and unable to fight at the UFC 223 event two nights later.
The former UFC champion posted a photo with a caption early Tuesday morning after he was released from jail posting a $12,500 bond at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami. In the photo he posted McGregor is seen leaving jail wearing a gray t-shirt with a faux newspaper cover featuring a headline reading &ldquo;McGregor is back!&rdquo; He captioned his post, &ldquo;Patience in this world is a virtue continue to work on. I love my fans dearly. Thank you all.&rdquo;
With continued controversy surrounding the fighter can he bounce back after his recent defeat against Khabib? The jury is still out on how his fans will react to his continued erratic behaviour, but for now he seems more interested in making headlines for the wrong reasons.

22,"So, we have a knife crime problem? And the epidemic does not seem to be ending, according to 'Anti Knife UK' in 2018 there have been 45,000 reported incidents related to knife crime, such as robbery and assault while 276 have been fatal. You'd think we are in a war torn country like Syria or Yemen but this is the bleak reality of modern day Britain. This years figures may even surpass that as fatal stabbings are at the highest level since records began. So, yes we have a serious problem&hellip;
While we can all blame the police cuts and the long winded waste of time that is Brexit, the issue of knife crime is deep rooted into our society. Why are more and more young kids carrying knives and using them? Political commentatorOwen Jones was spot on in his recent appearance on 'BBC Question Time' &lsquo;The issue of knife crime far outweighs policing&rsquo;. Regardless of the police numbers, we will still have a knife crime problem, while it may deter and reduce the numbers it will not solve the problem. We must dig deep and understand societal problems that have led our younger generation to this epidemic. 
We are certainly facing challenging times and as a result find ourselves in this conundrum, while policing needs to be addressed - not just numbers but better quality and more engaging policing. We should also interact with young adults and understand from them some of the reason behind the surge in knife crime. We also need to tackle some of the key aspects that is fueling and encouraging knife crime such as Britain's increasing gang culture, the rise in class A drugs and turf wars. 
The solutions needs to come from grassroots level not politician who are out of touch with the common man. With a lack of youth centres and community led activities more and more young kids are out on the streets who are vulnerable to grooming from gangs and drug dealers. With the lack of good quality jobs, youth centres and activities for our younger generation, the lavish lifestyle and street cred displayed by joining gangs and dealing drugs may seem appealing to them. 
Faron Paul, 31, &lsquo;daddy by day and vigilante by night&rsquo; has taken action on the matter. Paul set up a knife amnesty which collects the weapons from teenagers and then gives them to the police without revealing the identity of the original owner. He told Sky News: &lsquo;Everybody wants to know why I do this. I do it because I have kids and I want them to live long and happy lives.&lsquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous work, so I try to protect myself with a stab-proof vest and I normally have a friend and my dog with me, too. But you never know. &lsquo;But every time I take a knife off the street, I am probably saving a life and stopping someone from going to jail. &lsquo;To me that is worth the risk. I&rsquo;m trying to help build a better future for the next generation and a situation where local communities don&rsquo;t need to live in fear.&rsquo; 
Taking an ever bigger step forward, Chancellor Philip Hammond told the Commons a &ldquo;wider, cross-agency response to this epidemic&rdquo; was required. &ldquo;Action is needed now. So the prime minister and I have decided exceptionally, to make available immediately to police forces in England an additional &pound;100m.&rdquo; It seems finally the government are paying attention and acting, the announcement of extra funding can prove vital against the growing threat of knife crime. 
Home Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s vital police have the resources they need to crack-down on the rising levels of knife crime. I&rsquo;ve listened &amp; we will be giving &pound;100 million extra to forces, targeting the hardest hit areas. I&rsquo;ll continue to give police the support they need.&rdquo;
NPCC chief constable Sara Thornton said of the extra &pound;100m being promised: ""The additional government funding announced today is very welcome. It will help police forces strengthen our immediate response to knife crime and serious violence. She said all forces across England and Wales were undertaking a week-long intensive operation to tackle knife crime, including test purchasing weapons from shops, weapons sweeps and speaking to young people about the dangers of knives.
This is all very encouraging news, and we hope the police can take some time out to engage with communities at the grassroots level to fight this problem from the bottom up. Knife crime is not a new problem, but one that has taunted our society far too long. 
""Bringing violence down is a police priority.""

1438,"The Parliament of Ghana has began processes to pass a law that will regulate the use of modern technologies to aid childbirth.
The practice, referred to as Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) which includes In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and surrogacy, will be operated within a regulated space when the new law is eventually passed by the house.
IVF involves fertilization by extracting eggs or embryo from the woman, retrieving a sperm sample from the man, and then manually combining an egg and sperm in a laboratory dish.
Surrogacy is an arrangement, often supported by a legal agreement, whereby a woman agrees to become pregnant and give birth to a child for another person who is or will become the parent of the child.
Member of Parliament for North Tongu, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, making a statement on the floor of the house on Tuesday observed that these technologies have created a lucrative industry which has been left unregulated. He said there is the need for a law.
&ldquo;Mr. Speaker, from my research, the cost of a cycle of treatment here in Ghana ranges from between Fifteen Thousand US Dollars ($15,000) and Forty Thousand US Dollars ($40,000).
&ldquo;The challenge that ought to be confronted is the absolute absence of any form of regulation whatsoever&rdquo;, he said.
&ldquo;Already, evidence is emerging that this lacuna is leading to unethical practices and the blatant abuse of surrogacy and IVF processes here in Ghana&rdquo;, he added
Mr. Ablakwa observed that the commercialization of the ARTs, especially surrogacy in some parts of the world are barred.
&ldquo;In countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark and Belgium; surrogacy is allowed where the surrogate mother is not paid or only paid for reasonable expenses. Commercial surrogacy for profit is therefore prohibited in these countries&rdquo;, he said.
MP for Ledzokuku , Dr. Bernard Okoe Boye, in his contribution said it is surprising that consumable products and services are regulated but that of ARTs is not.
&ldquo;It is sad that the industries that produce commodities that are consumed have regulation and the industry that produces the most complex entity, human beings is without legislation. The time to act is now&rdquo;, he said
Minority Leader and MP for Tamale South, Haruna Iddrisu and the Deputy Majority Chief Whip, Matthew Nyindam, also made supportive contributions to have the law passed.
The Speaker of Parliament, Prof. Aaron Mike Oquaye, referred the issue to the combined committees on Health and, Constitutional and Legal Affairs.

23,"Sooo Conor McGregor randomly announces that he wants to retire from the UFC and sip Pina Coladas instead. I mean if you&rsquo;ve made over $100M from fighting wouldn&rsquo;t you want a break from it so you can sit back and chill ? 
During an appearance on &ldquo;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&rdquo; on Monday, former two-division UFC champion Conor McGregor said he was negotiating for a July fight, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re in talks for July, so we&rsquo;ll see what happens. [There are a] lot of politics going on. The fight game is a mad game but as I said again, to my fans, I am in shape and I am ready.&rdquo;
However, a few hours later the Irish mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter tweeted, 
Hey guys quick announcement, I&rsquo;ve decided to retire from the sport formally known as &ldquo;Mixed Martial Art&rdquo; today.
I wish all my old colleagues well going forward in competition.
I now join my former partners on this venture, already in retirement.
Proper Pina Coladas on me fellas!
This isn&rsquo;t the first time the controversial fighter announced his retirement, a month after losing to Nate Diaz in March 2016 he said he had decided to &ldquo;retire young&rdquo;, but returned to defeat the same opponent later that same year. McGregor, retiring five months after losing to Khabib Nurmagomedov in a controversial title fight in Las Vegas that sparked a brawl and led to a six-month ban, i think not.
UFC President Dana White, issued a statement of gratitude and encouragement to Yahoo Sports on Monday in which he said it makes sense for McGregor to retire. He&rsquo;s young and in good health, and having success selling his line of Irish whiskey, Proper 12.
&ldquo;He has the money to retire and his whiskey is KILLIN it, it totally makes sense. If I was him, I would retire, too. He&rsquo;s retiring from fighting, not from working. The whiskey will keep him busy and I&rsquo;m sure he has other things he&rsquo;s working on. He has been so fun to watch!!! He has accomplished incredible things in this sport. I am so happy for him and I look forward to seeing him be as successful outside of the octagon as he was in it.&rdquo;

24,"The Red Devils face one of the toughest teams in the world at Old Trafford in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final. They go head to head with the spanish team Barcelona starting off rocky after United&rsquo;s left-back Luke Shaw gave Barca a deserved lead only 12 minutes in when he deflected Luis Suarez's header into his own net, the goal was initially ruled out for offside but a brief consultation with VAR found no infringement and the goal was allowed to stand.
United improved as the game went on, though David de Gea had to be alert with 36 minutes on the clock, using his left foot to keep out Philippe Coutinho's effort. Diogo Dalot should have given United an equaliser soon after, meeting Marcus Rashford's deep cross and inexplicably putting a header across goal rather than towards it. Although the pattern of play improved the Devils struggled to craft meaningful chances allowing Barca to successfully hold on to the win.
In a post match interview United&rsquo;s manager was still proud of his team even though they didn&rsquo;t leave with a win, 
&ldquo;There are postives and negatives. I thought we started sloppy and we were a bit nervous on the ball. We didn't really get the pressure on them. After their goal, we settled a bit and we played well. We had some very good performances from some individuals as well, in midfield there &ndash; I thought they did really well.
&ldquo;At times it felt like a proper Man United team. The crowd was behind us, we got wide, we put in crosses. Sometimes those crosses end up with a header on goal and sometimes you miss them.&rdquo;
United&rsquo;s hopes remain alive as they look towards their second leg with the Spanish team at Camp Nou. 
&ldquo;[We lacked] that little quality towards the end, but then again we're playing against a good team. We know when you play against Barcelona you have to defend a lot without the ball and you might be a little bit tired when you get the chance yourself. There's positives to take, we can tighten up a few things and we'll go there with one thing in mind: we have to score.&rdquo;"

The NYSAC released the following statement &ldquo;The New York State Athletic Commission issued a one-year suspension and $10 thousand fine to Mr Dillashaw for violations relating to use of a prohibited substance. We have no further comment.&rdquo;USADA likewise released the following statement in regards to the matter &ldquo;In light of Mr. Dillashaw&rsquo;s social media post this morning, we can confirm that an in-competition test conducted by USADA on January 18, 2019 resulted in an adverse analytical finding. In this instance, we are able to confirm the finding due to Mr. Dillashaw&rsquo;s public statement. The presumption of innocence under the rules is a vital part of an effective anti-doping program and it&rsquo;s only fair that Mr. Dillashaw be allowed due process before any conclusions are drawn.&rdquo;
With the belt now up for grabs, who do yo think will be the next champion?"
26,"A second loss at Wolves in 17 days has left Manchester United looking a far less formidable rival at this moment. Out of the FA Cup and now relying on results around them to finish in the top 4 for a champions league spot.
United started the game well and scored early on through McTomminay, only for Wolves to equalize 10 mins later through Diogo Jota. United played within themselves for the most part of the game finding it difficult to break the solid Wolves unit down. Pogba, Lingard and others did not play well during the game and a 2nd half dismissal for Ashley Young after 2 yellow cards allowed Wolves to exploit space and due to a fortuous own goal by Smalling, allowing Wolves to snatch the lead and bag the win with a 2-1 victory.
United face Barcelona in a weeks time and the likes of Messi and Suarez will be salivating considering the performances of some of the United players. Having just been named permanent Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Soljaer will be hoping this result is just a minor bump on the road to success and his players can pick themselves up for their match against Barcelona. Out of the eight remaining teams in the Champions League Barcelona are widely considered the favourites to win this years champions league and with Messi in red hot form, one only wonders what United can do to stop him and co.

The prolific striker had previously missed the Blaugrana&rsquo;s Ladies&rsquo; last four league games due to a hamstring injury, but came on into the fray to grab a double against a strong Sevilla side.

27,"Ajax Amsterdam followed up their elimination of Real Madrid by showcasing their football skills which lead them to a 2-1 victory to Juventus, ending the Serie A team's dreams of winning the Champions League.
Having secured a 1-1 draw from the first leg in Amsterdam, Allegri's side appeared to be in control of the tie. Cristiano Ronaldo, aiming for a fourth successive Champions League title after winning the last three with Real Madrid, put Juventus ahead in the 28th minute with a header, his sixth goal of the competition. 
Victory was short lived as Hakim Ziyech's long-range shot hit a defender and fell perfectly for Van de Beek who, calmly sent the ball past Wojciech Szczesny, and into the net equalising the match.
In the second half De Ligt struck a successful shot to seal a 3-2 aggregate win and set up a last-four clash with either Manchester City or Tottenham.
Proud of his team coach Erik ten Hag made a statement, ""It's an incredible evening for Ajax and its players and also for Dutch football, once again we eliminated the favourites.&rdquo;
The Ajax players confident and determined also made statements after the match, 
&ldquo;Can we can go on to win the competition? Well, we are in the semifinals now. And we have eliminated two of the favourites in the last two rounds. The next games will be very difficult, but so were these ones. So who knows?,&rdquo; said De Ligt.
&ldquo;We dominated after the break and were well worth our victory. In fact, we probably should have won by more,&rdquo; added Frenkie de Jong.
Ronaldo unable to make a difference after his incredible hat-trick had pulled Juventus into the quarter-finals in the last-16 win over Atletico Madrid, signed for 100 million euros ($117 million) last summer from Real Madrid in a bid to win the European trophy for the first time since 1996, the 34-year-old wasn&rsquo;t victorious and went home disappointed.
&ldquo;Ajax deserved to qualify,&rdquo; said Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri.
&ldquo;We could have done better, but Ajax aren't coming out of nowhere, they were Europa League finalists two years ago and scored five goals against Real. It's not our worst elimination. We had big expectations, but the Champions League is a strange competition. You have to arrive in peak condition.&rdquo;

Lionel Messi was the star of the match according to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Ending a six-year quarter-final drought with a fine low strike at the 16th minute only 4 minutes apart from his second goal. Philippe Coutinho sealed the deal at the 61st minute creating the heaviest-ever aggregate defeat in a two-legged European tie for United concluded at 4-0.
United boss watched his team get pulled apart by another stunning performance from the Argentine forward. He showed his respect to the team even after losing, 
&ldquo;I have to say Lionel Messi is top quality and he was the difference of course,&rdquo; Solskjaer told BT Sport . &ldquo;At 2-0 straight after it was game over.&rdquo;

&ldquo;We need to create an environment of top, world-class attitude every single day. We've got a lot of good players to work with but as I have said, we have a rebuilding job. It started with coaches, players and of course one or two additions in the summer.&rdquo;
When asked about Barca's Champions League chances ahead of a semi-final against either Liverpool or Porto, Solskjaer told reporters: &ldquo;I think Barcelona will win yeah.&rdquo;
&ldquo;With the quality they have in the front three. They've got Dembele and Malcom, players there to put on. I wouldn't bet against them, even though I don't bet.&rdquo; &ldquo;But for me they will be favourites to win the whole tournament.&rdquo;
Barca will discover their semi-final opponents on Wednesday when Liverpool take their 2-0 lead to Porto, while for United their focus switches to the top-four race in the Premier League.

29,"BREXIT... it's almost a new phenomenon, a groundbreaking invention - finally cars can fly&hellip;or maybe not. For most of us, myself included, it&rsquo;s all getting very confusing and to some extent uninterested, this saga has been played out far too long without any end in sight. The country was asked a question &lsquo;REMAIN&rsquo; or &lsquo;LEAVE&rsquo; and to everyone&rsquo;s surprise &lsquo;LEAVE&rsquo; won. It&rsquo;s like a forced divorce that neither party wants to see through, either way, we have to uphold democracy, the same democracy we preach around the world and start wars on...
As an article from &lsquo;nytimes&rsquo; put it &ldquo;Brexit: the most boring important story in the world&rdquo;. That is the reality we are left with, we all recognise the importance but are bored of it. Weather you voted &lsquo;LEAVE or &lsquo;REMAIN&rsquo;, I am certain we all want the country to move forward to tackle the many challenges facing the nation, from NHS funding, to cost of living, Job creation, and the elephant in the room &ndash; Knife crime. And it is these very same challenges that has led us to where we are today, voters are not satisfied with the status-quo, people want change regardless good or bad. The same can be said about America and Trump, who would of thought?
We still have a long way to go, but there is a question of whether BREXIT will ever become a reality, with parliament unable to agree on anything and everyone pointing fingers, it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s game...No deal Brexit? Deal? Or maybe another referendum? It all seems like an episode from Channel four&rsquo;s &lsquo;Deal or No Deal&rsquo; without Noel Edmond and his hilariousness and the banker replaced by another vote. The vast majority of us don&rsquo;t really understand what is going on and how any of this will impact our everyday lives. The government must step up and explain to everyone what this all means.
Let's hope parliament can put party politics aside for once and do what is right by the country&hellip;Your guess is as good as mine as to what that may be."
30,"Jurgen Klopp hinted that he didn't believe Liverpool could pull off a Champions League miracle against Barcelona, admitting Monday that &ldquo;beautiful failure&rdquo; was perhaps the best his team could hope for against the Spanish champions.
Liverpool at Anfield, in the midst of all the myths and fairy tales surrounding this place came true on an unforgettable night of pulsating and fearless football. 
Liverpool entered the second leg of the Champions League semifinal on Tuesday facing what was viewed as an improbable 3-0 deficit. The Reds had the support of the Anfield crowd but were without the services of Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino as they were out due to injuries. Liverpool managed to defy the odds and pulled off a 4-0 victory advancing them to the Champions League final on June 1 in Madrid, Spain against the winner of Tottenham vs. Ajax. 
Liverpool dominated the game from really early on with Divock Origi scoring in the opening minutes. The team was united all through the game which helped them take the lead in the second half.
Only minutes after coming on, Georginio Wijnaldum scored, making it 2-0. Then just three minutes later, Wijnaldum did it again with a header goal. 
&ldquo;Things got on top of us after those two quick goals,&rdquo; Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde admitted post-match. &ldquo;We didn't manage to get on the score sheet, and they rolled us over, really.&rdquo;
Valverde was right. Barcelona were rolled over. So much for the best team in Spain; they simply crumbled when faced with Liverpool's intensity and drive. 
It wasn't all done at 3-0. Barcelona were still in it, knowing one goal would bring the game back in their favour. However, in the 79th minute, Barcelona simply fell asleep at a corner, with Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross to Origi catching them completely flat-footed. Origi struck again making the game 4-0 and put Liverpool ahead. 
Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde offered his view on his team&rsquo;s Champions League exit and says they have &ldquo;no excuses&rdquo; for their defeat to Liverpool.
&ldquo;They were better than us and we have to accept it. Their second goal hurt us massively and the third one came straight after that. We did not convert our chances into goals.
&ldquo;When a team overturns a lead like that and fights back like they have done, there can be no excuses. We suspected Liverpool would play higher up the pitch than last week &ndash; they did that and we weren&rsquo;t capable of shaking off their high press.
&ldquo;Goals are always somebody&rsquo;s fault, some mistake or other. If you stop to look at any goal you&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s an error in there. They surprised us with the fourth goal &ndash; presumably my players weren&rsquo;t looking. Liverpool were streetsmart and they scored.&rdquo;
4-0, and thousands of Liverpudlians could start to book their flights to Madrid, while the same number of Catalans cancel their hotels. &ldquo;The whole game was too much,&rdquo; Klopp said. &ldquo;It was overwhelming. We played against maybe the best team in the world. Winning is difficult, but winning with a clean sheet, I don't know how they did it. It's unbelievable.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I saw James Milner crying on the pitch after the game. It means so much to all of us. It's the best phase of football. There are more important things in the world. But creating this emotional atmosphere together is so special.&rdquo;
This was Liverpool's night, and nobody inside Anfield will ever forget it. The question now lies is if they could carry this passion into the final thus leading to them lifting the cup on June 1.

31,"Just 24 hours afterLiverpool pulled off a comeback for the ages, Tottenhamsealed one of its ownby scoring three unanswered second-half goals to complete a 3-2 win over Ajax in the Champions League semifinal on Wednesday and advance on the away goals tiebreaker after a 3-3 aggregate draw.
Spurs midfielder Lucas Moura was the team's hero on another night of Champions League drama. The Brazillian completed his hat trick in the final seconds of the match with the deciding goal, devastating the Ajax defense to send Tottenham to the Champions League final in miraculous fashion.
Ajax started off hot and it looked the Dutch side would cruise to the final. Matthijs de Ligt and Hahim Ziyech scored in the first half to take a 2-0 lead and put the pressure on Spurs, who were already without injured star striker Harry Kane. 
However, after the break, Lucas scored two quick goals to get his team back into it.
In stoppage time, Spurs went forward in need of the third goal. Jan Vertonghen of Tottenham hit the crossbar and Hakim Ziyechof Ajax hit the post, and then it was bedlam. In panic mode, Fernando Llorente used his big frame to play Dele Alli, and the midfielder slipped a little ball through to Lucas who pulled off the miraculous goal to help his team advance to the final.
Just 24 hours after Liverpool'simprobable comebackwin over Barcelona, a comeback that was just as impressive, just as shocking, and just as unexpected.
Tottenham is now through to its first UCL final, while Ajax's dream run comes to an end. Tottenham will face Liverpool in the all-Premier League Champions League final on June 1. It's the first final featuring two English clubs since 2008 (Manchester United vs. Chelsea).
Tottenham will be playing in their first European Cup final in 57 years. Ajax's journey that began in the second qualifying round in July, ended in abject misery and disbelief."
32,"The United States won the Women's World Cup for a record fourth time as they eventually overpowered the Netherlands in Lyon.
The European champions, reaching the final in only their second World Cup, kept the favorites at bay in the first half as former Arsenal goalkeeper Sari van Veenendaal produced four excellent saves.
But the USA, playing in their third consecutive final, continued their reign as the world's finest side as they added to their titles of 1991, 1999 and 2015.
Second-half goals from co-captain Megan Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle ensured victory for the American team who produced a dominant display at the Stade de Lyonin the second half, after resilient first-half defending from the Dutch.
It is the USA's fourth Women's World Cup win and gives them back-to-back titles following their victory at the 2015 tournament in Canada.
Rapinoe converted a penalty in the final after a decision by the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled striker Alex Morgan had been fouled.
The goal saw her finish alongside team-mate Morgan and England's Ellen White as the tournament's joint top-scorer with six goals.
Rapinoe won the Golden Boot having achieved six goals and three assists in fewer minutes than Morgan, as well as picking up the Golden Ball trophy after being voted the tournament's best player.
Victory for the USA saw their English-born boss Jill Ellis become the first coach to lift the trophy twice after previously leading the USA's successful campaign in 2015. TheUSA women's football club is the second team to win the competition twice in a row, matching the fate of 2003 and 2007 champions Germany.
The prize money for the women's tournament is being doubled from $30m to $60m (&pound;26.7m to &pound;53.4m) for the next event.However, the men's prize pot is rising to $440m (&pound;391.8m) for the 2022 competition - an increase of $40m (&pound;35.6m) since 2018.
Rapinoe said: ""It's certainly not fair. Double it now and use that number to double it or quadruple it for the next time.
""If you really care about the game in the same way, why are you letting the gap grow?""
Rapinoe also accused FIFA of disrespecting the women's game, saying the decision to schedule three major international games on the same day was disrespectful.
The finals of the Copa America and the Gold Cup, which will feature the USA men's team, are also taking place on Sunday.
""We don't feel the same level of respect that FIFA has for the men or just in general,"" she said."
33,"Kenyacame from behind twice to beat neighboursTanzania3-2 in their Group C clash at theAfrica Cup of Nations(Afcon) on Thursday night. Michael Olunga grabbed a brace in a game that Harambee Stars had done everything right but only managed to take the lead in the 80th minute.
The victory in thematch dubbed the East Africa Derby boosts Kenya's chances of progressing to the knockout phase of the competition but means Tanzania will go home after their final Group C match againstAlgeria.
After their disappointing performance in losing 2-0 to Algeria in the opening game, Kenya made three changes to the starting XI. 
After a slow start, Kenya made a tactical substitution. Having started in a 4-2-3-1 formation with Francis Kahata as a number ten, Migne took him off and brought on a second genuine striker in John Avire. This made the shape a 4-4-2 and saw Harambee Stars abandonmost attempts to play out from the back and instead looked direct for Olunga and Avire, with the two wide players coming inside to dribble or to look for second balls.

The move immediately brought dividends as Kenya broke after defending a Tanzanian corner, where Avire was fouled on the right flank. When the freekick came in, Manula flopped at the delivery and Olunga levelled with a fine overhead kick.

The lead did not last long though as Samatta&rsquo;s run in-behind on Kenya&rsquo;s right saw his attempted cross blocked, before picking up the loose ball and firing in. Owino had allowed a pass, before diving in when the ball broke loose. At half-time, Migne brought on Bernard Ochieng at right to replace the struggling fullback.
On social media, it was hard to avoid the fact that Kenya vs Tanzania was among the top trends worldwide, with fans from both countries and those following the action from the diaspora channeling their thoughts on the match through their accounts.
Here are some of the reactions;


Kenya will now play Senegal in the last group stage match that will see the winners grab another round of 16 tickets while Tanzania face off with Algeria who have already booked a spot in the knockout stage."
34,"Kenyan National team Harambee Stars startled its fan base last week after hinting that the blockbuster AFCON match against Senegal will be their last in the 2019 competition. They certainly didn&rsquo;t put out good vibes into the atmosphere because they lost their match against Senegal at 3-0.

Victor Wanyama, the figurehead of the Kenyan team, the first Kenyan to play in the Premier League at Southampton, before switching to Tottenham in 2016.

Kenya boss Sebastien Migne expressed, ""For me, the coach, and for the rest of the staff, we are happy to have a player who is able to compete at this level.""

""It will help us to send a message to our opponents. We have one of the finalists of the Champions League in our team. In terms of confidence, it will be perfect for us.""

Sadly not even Kenya&rsquo;s first football superstar could help the team in their slump against Senegal. Kenya needed at least a draw to be guaranteed proper qualification to the next round with four points but the loss prolonged their wait. After The teams loss in their final group C match, they will have to wait for the final group matches to know their fate.

Regardless of their fate Kenyan&rsquo;s online are still proud and some fans took to twitter to showcase their emotions,

Wiper Party Leader Kalonzo Musyoka tweeted, ""Well done #HarambeeStars for playing your hearts out in the #KenyaVsSenegal match in #AFCON2019""

Steve G. another twitter user expressed his gratitude by tweeting, ""We might have lost out in #AFCON2019 but at least these two heroes were born here....kudos #HarambeeStars #KENSEN #KenyaVsSenegal Michael Olunga... Patrick Matasi hats off.....!""

Even the former Prime Minister took to twitter tweeting,
""Thank you #HarambeeStars 🇰🇪 for giving your best. We live to fight another day. Let&rsquo;s build on the #AFCON2019 🏆 experience for future tournaments. Great effort by Patrick Matasi."""
35,"Essentially, this is an obnoxious question that requires to be solved. This is a question we do ask within ourselves, but we've not really thought about that deterrent thought that keeps roaming and bugging our mindset. We aren't certain if what we are inclined to do at a particular moment is right or wrong, but that thought just keep on thrusting and then we end up making mistakes due to conclusion without cogitation. The thought that inclines us to make mistakes are thoughts from our subconscious mind. When our mind is subdued by our subconscious while making a proper balance,something egregious occurs,why? Because we think negatively and often pessimistic. Now,we have to conceive the translucent talisman with the intials PMA(postive mental attitude) emblazoned on one side and NMA(negative mental attitude) on the other to help achieve a better idea. Judgments and action should be the result of the conscious and subconscious working in balnce."

37,"Never did anyone think of a worldwide destruction after the world have already experienced the brunt of 2 great wars in the history that almost destroyed the world. The world made certain treaties with the criminals of the war nations to inhibit such an annihilation anywhere in the world. The dawn of the digital world made sure that the war isn't direct but through various medium. Leaders across different countries piloted their nations for their steadfast development. This catapulted the growth of various technology that gave rise to many indirect wars termed or fancied, whatever way you put it , called ""Cold War"".
COLD WARS
The cold war commenced immediately after the WWII across various countries out of which the most notable was the geopolitical tensions between the WWII winner - USA and Asia's Juggernaut - Russia. A neutral bloc arose with the Non-Aligned Movement, which sought good relations with both sides. Notwithstanding relatively isolated incidents of air-to-air dogfights and shoot-downs, the two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat. However, both were heavily armed in preparation for a possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear strategy that discouraged an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker&mdash;the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). A wave of mutual relations and disagreements between these two nations with their allies paved way for the dent of the Soviet Union and USA remained the only superpower.
The unrest between the waring nations continued even after the strategic supremacy of USA went beyond the grasp of other nations. ""Cold War II"" gained relevance as tensions between Russia and the West escalated in Ukraine followed by the Russian military intervention and especially the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014. By August 2014, both sides had implemented economic, financial, and diplomatic sanctions upon each other: virtually all Western countries, led by the US and European Union, imposed punitive measures on Russia, which introduced retaliatory measures. Russia, the sole leader of Asia gained their territorial advantage with Middle East imposing various rules on them and preventing other nations escalation on them.
The Syrian War and the Insurgency
Since the destabilization of power in the Syria and protests across the middle east countries, chaos and misery flows much greater than tourists in the region which have fueled western countries to stand by or against the weakened landmass. WIth so many vying for power across the arid oil factories, it has paved wayfor a full direct conflict after the so-called COLD WAR. The war is basically divided into many fragments, each splintered with its own motive. The insurgency and the tensions between Lebanon and Syria, terrorist outfits camping in Afgan and Pakistan, the Israel and Iranian conflicts, all pieces broken down to such fragments that people couldn't recognise the bigger picture that its going to become a ragging war for oil across the supreme leaders of the west and the east.
A New Leader across the Horizon
Ghost Fleet - A political thriller film imagines what a 21st century world war might look like pitting the US, China and Russia against each other complete with cyber-warfare, robotics and drones. But could this nightmarish fiction turn into dystopian reality? America was the first to see one of the developing country in Asia to pose a threat to its intelligence and trade supplies. During the Obama administration, the Pentagon pursued the pivot to Asia aiming to transfer 60 per cent of naval bases to Asia. The US also strengthened alliances with Japan and other Far East partners to &ldquo;contain&rdquo; China. US have also started to build missile defense system in South Korea owing to a preposing threat to its ally, after its stand-off in the South China Sea. China on the other hand, annexed various small islands across the surrounding seas and have started to increase its military presence in the Indian Ocean.
The Trump transition is likely to exacerbate US-China tensions. Trump has threatened a trade war with China. Over the few years, China have insulated their policies to protect it against various international organizations and have implemented various trade tariffs for imports and exports from Chinese companies which totally rules it against US's Intellectual Property and Patents.
Korean Stronghold
Korean War started during the cold war and as a result, it was split into two sovereign countries. North Korea with the help of Soviet Union and China and South Korea allying with USA waged a war and the LOC couldn't be established as the territories were wobbling horrendously. WIth the help of UN Force and the Japanese force, USA was able to halt the progress of surprising Chinese intervention and the 38th parallel was formed which later became the border between the nations. After a string of Sanctions, North Korea claimed its armistice Treaty(restriction to use any sort of armory or weaponry) to be invalid and posed a state of war with South Korea.USA, in addition to being an ally of SOuth KOrea, wanted to gain a strategic stronghold in he Indian Ocean placed its troops ready for counter attack. Later, North Korea approached the United States about conducting formal peace talks to formally end the war. While the White House agreed to secret peace talks, the plan was rejected due to North Korea's refusal to discuss nuclear disarmament as part of the terms of the treaty. Eventhough, the two Korean nations agreed for complete denuclearization of the area, troops are still placed in the region by UN as well as Soviet nations.
Indian Notoriety
Kashmir which once completely belonged to the Indian Peninsula, now has been split into 3 regions, one that belongs to Pakistan after the Kargil war, another fragment belonging to the Chinese due to the advancing troops in the region owing to Post Indo-Sino War. Right from the pact till present, there has been raging wars in this region and most of the troops being deployed in the region to counteract the terrorist camps. Off lately, the tensions have been rising to multiple folds with Chinese silently refraining their unbiased support from Pakistan. China focusing on the South China sea problems,would possibly increase its maritime operations in Indian Ocean and India preparing for this, has asked for joint navel exercises with Japan and USA. India being an Ally to USA and in peace talks with Russia, both on their backs, it will be extremely difficult to open an all-out war which might easily escalate to Nuclear War.
Remember a World War III scenario is at this stage no more than a hypothesis. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out entirely because it has already happened twice &ndash; in the last 100 years. As a species we are still capable of unthinkable aggression. Moreover, human error is an ever-present factor. Kennedy and Khrushchev nearly blundered into a flat-out nuclear exchange in 1962 over Russian missile sites in Cuba. On the other hand, we live in a much more interconnected world with so much more to lose and so many more channels to communicate.
The Bio-Warefare and the Cyber-Warefare have been more the pronounced term in the currently growing digital world of the information Age. It is highly possible that Machines will make decisions far more quickly and accurately than man does and this relationship would boost mankind to either annihilate himself or possibly to a new age which could be enlightened as Intelligence Age."
38,"During the start of the century when the agricultural and digital revolution ceded, rose the new era of digital world, the information age. The age along with its devastating development force bought with it many forms of entertainment, of which one of them was Games played on individual consoles or through internet with different players around the world.
Mario,Spacewars and Age of empires are some of the few games that ruled the leaderboards in our childhood. But no one came up with an idea of engaging it to the spectators and make money out of it until one day, a handpicked list of the best Spacewar! players at the school were invited to watch and compete, and the lucky winner would take home a subscription to Rolling Stone magazine.

For a game to become a sport, it needs three core components: competition, tournaments and spectators. The foundation was set on a rather unfaithful day at theStanford AI lab for the nascent world of video games to one day achieve widespread spectatorship and popularity.
Dawn of New Era :
People started to compete in tournaments, bragging rights and sponsorship. Teams who were once unknown came into existence on the event of tournaments held by gaming sponsors.As the growth of the internet enabled more connections around the world, gaming was an inevitable addition.It was an entirely new gaming experience.
Players no longer needed to track down a friend at the arcade to battle; their opponent could be on the other side of the world or in a house down the street. As hardware advanced, connections improved, and developers enabled gamers to talk to each other, online gaming started to boom.

This boom in turn allowed people to tune into streaming networks and paved way for the on-demand spectatorship. As the spectators rose, we have had tremendous rise in the sponsorship and new companies still do dig in to provide some of their treasury.
One tourney, Many Breakthroughs:
In 1998, Blizzard developed an online multiplayer game namely Warcraft which was popular among the South Asian Countries. People formed teams to compete against one another for a few paltry prices. Then dawned the king of all tourneys, ""THE INTERNATIONAL"" in the year 2011 which was the first breakthrough accumulating all of the international players under one banner and the winner takes a huge prize money of 1 million dollars.

This tournament have bought to light many of the players hithertho unknown. Mathews founded Fnatic 13 years ago, with financial support from his mother, and has built it into one of the world&rsquo;s most successful teams, competing in more than 600 tournaments globally, in games such as Counter-Strike, Dota2, Call Of Duty, Overwatch and League of Legends.
""Esports is one of the games that is global and addictive at the same time. It can pull you in and never go out of you"".
There arose many organizations which controlled teams for different teams. Organisations under which the gamers played for, became a huge success and eventually paved way for rise of new tourneys and today, we have certain real sports organizations signing up esports teams, we have PSG football club sign up LGD Gaming from China. The goal is near, Digital sports will rule the virtual world sooner than expected and a vast reservoir of revenue.

According to the source's estimates, global eSports market revenue will reach 1.65 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. The eSports industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. In 2017, the global eSports market was valued at nearly 493 million U.S. dollars.It was calculated that nearly 80 percent of these revenues came from sponsorships and advertising in 2016, and the rest from eSports betting, prize pools, tournaments, merchandise and ticket sales. In terms of revenues, Asia and North America represent the two largest eSports markets.
Future of E-Sports:
If you look closely at the progress of one of the tournaments, it is inevitable to deny the fact that the prize money have been rising exponentially like never before. People have started to indulge themselves on a virtual platform for a career and established the,selves as a gamer or caster. Esports doesn't just revolve around the team that play, organizations have put in therapist, analyst and coach, just as an outdoor sports.

New gaming organizations, new companies, new websites , new webapps, new designations and esports betting have a lot to offer for people. There are certain universities around the world studying and supporting the rise of new games.
Does the future hold good for the esports to bloom across regions unexplored or has it already touched midas?

Wolfgat (20-seater restaurant) based in Cape Town, was opened two years ago in a 130-year-old cottage, in Paternoster with the beautiful overview of the beach. It is named after the Wolfgat cave. Chef Kobus van der Merwe raised in Stellenbosh started taking cooking serious when he was 30 years old.
This is the second accolade Chef Kobus has recieved after being dubbed the Eat Out S.Pellegri and Acqua Panna Chef of the year in 2018. Chef Kobus said "" I do not feel worthy. It's a big tittle. My staff who go out everyday gathering herbs, succulents and dune spinach should be here, it's their baby"".
""I can't wait to celebrate with them with a big glass of South African sparkling wine""."
42,"Kane converted from a penalty spot few minutes past hour mark to cancel out Ramsey's first half goal, while Aubameyang came in as a sub to miss a glorious chance to secure all three points for ten-men Gunners in a tightly packed derby face-off.
Riding into the contest on a back of two straight defeats was always going to demand a ""put in your 'A' game"" performance from Tottenham Hotspur who the odds favored to run out victors in the yet stern test. Opposite became the case, however, as in the 16th minutes Spurs found themselves in a bit of a doghouse when a deadly mistake from fullback Davidson Sanchez had team mate Victor Wanyama chasing a rainbow in a bid to stop Ramsey who managed to put the ball in the back of the net by going round Hugo Lloris, spurs keeper.
The home supporters dropped down on morale to the outcome, as they watched their players play a bigger part of first half without much flow, creativity or spirit. That soon changed dead into the first half, when striker Harry kane opted in to produce a sublime pass which forced the hero out of Arsenal's golie -Leno- who executed two top class saves to deny Erickson a close range tuck-in with his feet, then again reacting quickly to slap off a surging rebound shot from Sissoko over the bar to preserve the thin lead.
The game continued second half in a tightly drab flow as normal, and despite Mauricio Pochetino's Spurs enjoying over 60% of ball possession, they still were unable to pose any real threat to Unai Emery's Arsenal. But what ensured that changed was a reckless foul on Eric Lamela by Xhaka in the 74th minutes, staging a freekick that would see fullback shkodran Mustafi penalized for a deliberate trip on Harry kane in the penalty box. Of course Kane stepped up and drove the ball home to level up.
With parity restored, it was game-on for both teams with home side seizing momentum and now believing in the possibility of making off with at least a split in points safe in the bag, but a difficult situation met them few seconds before the final whistle when a close call by referee -Anthony Taylor- gifted Aubameyang 'the moment', standing over the ball with only 12-yards from goal. As he struck with finesse like he does, brilliant Lloris notched up a great save, calming frayed nerves on home stand by denying the away team victory, while also ensuring an equal splitting of spoils from match ground."
43,"Super charged Liverpool ran riot at the Allianz Arena in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League date away to Bayern. With 3-1 twatting of the Bavarians, coach Niko Kovac was left apologizing for his team&rsquo;s slow pace.
For many reasons, especially for shutting the mouths of critics who thought Liverpool could not handle the pressures of Champions League weighing down on their Premier League title chase, Jurgen Klopp will have felt exhilarated -and giggled at those who told him to focus only on the Premier League, as his boys delivered him victory over a worthy European powerhouse.
With Manchester City cruising in form; leading the Premier League, while also absolutely destroying Shalke04 in a 10-2 score line aggregate in the Champions League; pressure rose high on Liverpool, who reacted firstly over the weekend to slash off the points gap from four to just one behind City, and secondly, to come away and snap up a win against a side like Bayern.
Jurgen Klopp had complained about tight, unfair match scheduling his team was getting between leagues, but a result like this easily erases any worries from the past.
A goalless draw in the first leg at Anfield was not going to get their team&rsquo;s name inside the draw-box in Friday last eight Champions League draws, and Mane remembered that in the 26th minutes when he opened the scoring by collecting a fine pass from Virgil Van Dijk, and with a fine twist and turn, dribbled Manuel Neuer to guide the ball into the net.
Bayern grabbed the equalizer when a Fabinho inflicted freekick caused Serge Gnabry to receive a pass to throttle behind Andrew Robertson and eventually squaring-in a cross in search of Roberto Lewandowski before Joel Matif interfere to concede an own goal while trying put the ball out to safety.
Yes! Bayern scored but didn&rsquo;t quite look themselves in the second half, except for Gnabry who almost appeared to be doing all the work up front, with Ribery old and sloppy, and Lewandowski pocketed by Van Dijk and his gang.
Mohammed Salah played actively but continued in his agonizing goal draught, as it was from James Milner&rsquo;s cross that Van Dijk towered in to the back of the net to make it 2-1, before Mane again saw off the match with an 84th minutes header to seal the win.
With Liverpool qualifying, it now becomes a total of four English teams in the last eight -others are Manchester United, Manchester City and Tottenham, a fit last seen since the 2008/09 season."
44,"In overturning a two-goal deficit carried over from first leg, Portuguese football genius put up rich show of the night by stealing all three goals from the match ground, and continuing his nightmarish role to Atletico Madrid&rsquo;s Champions League ambitions.
It was a night literally requiring an absolute miracle for Juventus to go through to the quarter finals of the UEFA Champions League, thanks to their 2-0 loss away to Madrid in the first leg of round 16.
Madrid were as dogged as ever back in the Spanish capital where they bullied out two second half goals to run out comfortable victors against Juve.
As disappointing as the loss was for Massimiliano Alegri&rsquo;s old ladies, they were still haunted and forced to embrace a certain history of never having to defeat Madrid, so for Juve, the road was a dead end, and hope?, already flushing down away like water under the bridge.
But &lsquo;wonder-man' Ronaldo showed up just in the nick of time, right before Atletico Madrid were about putting the final nail on the coffin.
And Juventus would later be thankful they expended over &euro;294m mad price in signing fee and wages put together to acquire the services on the five-time world&rsquo;s best player of the year.
 At 27th minutes, Ronaldo drew first blood for Juventus by beating Juanfran to head the ball home, fully utilizing an aerial cross from team-mate Bernardeschi, who had an equally superb night show off. The first half ended with Juve leading by a lone goal, but Atletico Madrid were still ahead on aggregate.
As the second half settled in, Ronaldo had his second moment of the match, this time he was setup by Cancelo for a header which he delivered too good for Oblak to parry away.
With the game all level on aggregate, it was still an open contest for both sides, perhaps more open for Atletico who were then looking for edge over with an away goal.
But only minutes before final whistle, Bernardeschi was tripped in the penalty box, offering Ronaldo his third moment, this time, to close the deal and complete a potentially epic comeback.
Making no mistakes, Ronaldo drove it home to deport Madrid back to Spanish capital, raising his all time UEFA Champions League goal tall to 127 goals to stand tall in his own league."
45,"Fenerbahce completed a 2-1 comeback versus Sivasspor late on Friday at home to redeem Moses&rsquo;s promise to fans, and advance their chances of staying above the drop zone.
After a lost in the penultimate round to Istanbul Basaksehir, the Chelsea loanee was happy to have kept his word to supporters by providing an assist that helped his team overturn a goal deficit to win the match.
Having played out a goalless first half, the visitors were the first to response in the final quarter of the match through a fine display by Ozer Hurmaci.
But only few seconds later, Moses proved his worth by delivering a decent pass which was converted by former Spurs and Real Madrid striker Soldado in the 74th minutes.
With four minutes from regulation time, Ersun Yanal&rsquo;s men closed the score sheet with a goal from substitute Mehmet Ekici, after he got the assist from Hasan Kaldirim.
The win which was only Fenerbahce&rsquo;s seventh this season, saw them climb one step up from 14th to 13th position in the league table, advancing their fight to stay above the relegation zone.
'First of all I just want to say thanks to the players for showing great character after being 1-0 down&rdquo;, Moses said, expressing his delight during his post match interview.
''We wanted to win this game before the international break to regroup ourselves to make sure we look forward to the next game and hopefully start winning games. I thought we worked so hard today as a team, collectively and individually. This is a massive, huge three points for us.''
Since leaving Chelsea to join the Turkish outfit on loan, Moses has managed eight games and score twice this season."
46,"Arsenal&rsquo;s free scoring Folarin Balogun notched himself a brace in their 5-2 hammering of West Ham, while highly rated winger Deji Sotona starred for Manchester United in Saturdays Under 18 English Premier League youth matches.
Balogun&rsquo;s brace in West Ham clash brought his goal tally to an impressive 22 goals in all competitions this season. He doubled Arsenal&rsquo;s goal cushion in the 28th minute, and then went on to grab another one dead into the second half.
Joshua Okocha was also a notable Nigerian who suffered a defeat in the match as he featured as a defender for West Ham, while Arthur Okonkwo was an unused substitute for the hammers.
Balogun, a New York City-born goal getter who had been on the radars of the English FA, was recently rewarded a call-up to England U18s squad for his fine form ahead of their international dates with Mexico, Japan and Czech Republic.
Despite billed for international duties with the Three Lions at junior level, Balogun, who is of Nigerian descent, is still eligible to play for the Super Eagles, and he has made it clear it is possible in the future.
With the victory over West Ham, Balogun&rsquo;s Arsenal sits on top of U18 Premier League with four points clear of closest rivals Tottenham Hotspur.
Elsewhere in Newcastle United Football Academy pitch, Deji Sotona came in as a substitute for Manchester United as they thrashed Newcastle 3-1 courtesy of goals from Charlie McCann and Anthony Elanga.
Sotona is a highly pacy and dribbling winger whose style of play is similar to club legend Ryan Giggs, and many have tipped him to succeed like the veteran.
Despite having made appearances for the Republic of Ireland at Under 15 and 16 respectively, Deji Sotona is open to play for the Super Eagles for having Nigerian parents."
387,"A court in Hong Kong on Wednesday sentenced eight leaders of a massive 2014 pro-democracy protests to up to 16 months in prison.
It wasreported in the media that Nine leaders of the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;Occupy Central&rdquo; protests that crippled parts of the former British colony for 79 days in late 2014 were convicted last month of public nuisance offences.
Nine defendants, including law professor Benny Tai, 54, retired sociologist Chan Kin-man, 60, and retired pastor Chu Yiu-ming, 75, were found guilty of at least one public nuisance charge each over their roles in planning and mobilising supporters during the protest.
It was gathered that Wednesday&rsquo;s decision followed a trial lasting almost a month at a time when Hong Kong&rsquo;s freedoms and autonomy came under increasing strain from China&rsquo;s Communist Party leaders, stoking concern from foreign governments, rights groups and businesspeople."
388,"The All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council has written to the Inspector General of Police and Director of the Department of State Services urging them to investigate the Peoples Democratic Party&rsquo;s leadership over its illegal access to the server of the Independent National Electoral Commission.
In a letter signed by the Director, Strategic Communications, APC Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, the party said the only conclusion it could draw from the above was that the PDP had prepared those results which were to be smuggled into the INEC server.
It said the security agencies should step in to investigate how the PDP allegedly gained access to the INEC facility and for what purpose it did so.
&ldquo;The APC Presidential Campaign Council hereby prays that the Inspector-General of Police and the Director-General of the Department of State Services use your good offices to investigate the hacking of and/or illegal tampering with the INEC server by the PDP. The leadership of the PDP must be invited, interrogated and investigated and those identified as perpetrators must be arrested and prosecuted,&rdquo; said APC.
APC said that while opposition is healthy in a democracy, it is not a licence for criminality and illegality, adding that it will be wrong for the country to condone such a blatant criminal claim by the PDP of having illegal access to INEC&rsquo;s server.
APC alleged in the petition that following the last-minute postponement of the February 16, 2019 Presidential/National Assembly Elections, the nation was shocked to see already prepared presidential election results floating around in the cyber space just less than 24 hours after the postponed election was originally billed to hold.
It said that the fake results had details of the scores of the candidates of the major parties.APC Campaign council said the fake results gave victory to the candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, even when elections did not hold.
It further said that despite the approval of the February 23 presidential elections as credible by nearly all local and international observers the PDP cried foul and made a shocking claim.
It said PDP claimed that from purported results it obtained from INEC&rsquo;s server, it had proof that its candidate won the election by about 1.6million votes!
&ldquo;Shockingly and coincidentally, this margin was about the same margin by which it also purportedly &ldquo;won&rdquo; by the fake results released just hours after the postponement of the February 16, 2019 Presidential/National Assembly Elections.&ldquo;As if this expensive joke was not enough, the PDP and its Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, have gone ahead to file an Election Petition against the clear victory of President Muhammadu Buhari and have repeated the same outlandish claim of having access to INEC&rsquo;s server which shows that they have some purported results at their disposal giving &ldquo;victory&rdquo; to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar&rdquo;, it said.
The APC campaign team explained that INEC&rsquo;s server is the back end of electronic records of INEC and not just its website.
It said that although, the purported results have been conclusively shown by public engagements to be false and even ridiculous, especially as the total number of accredited voters is exactly equivalent to the purported votes of the APC and PDP candidates, it showed that PDP agents had access to INEC server.
&ldquo;It is now clear that some criminally-minded PDP operatives have access to the INEC server to be able to smuggle in fake results into that server.
&ldquo;The only means by which they could have access to the INEC server is by the criminal hacking of the server or through the criminal conspiracy of some INEC officials,&rdquo; APC campaign team said."
47,"Alex Iwobi is set to continue in his midfield role against Seychelles, the team&rsquo;s last training session revealed on Friday, but the free role is still only temporary pending when Mikel Obi makes his return to the national team.
The Arsenal star picked up the No.10 responsibility since the end of Russia 2018 World Cup, the same time Mikel last made an appearance for the Super Eagles of Nigeria.
Speaking about the Super Eagles captain, Mikel Obi, who Iwobi sets to deputize, coach Gernot Rohr reveals more information about what is keeping the former Chelsea man from hitting the camp.
''He has so many games in Middlesbrough to look forward to, they are fighting for the playoff too.
''He told me it is not the moment to return but if Obi Mikel is very fit again and has the motivation, and shows that he is better than the other people we have, the door is open for everybody.
''I am not like Joachim Low who announced officially that three of his players are definitely out of the German national team, I never say that because you never know what can happen, you can have injuries, you can have great performances from the players who are returning from injuries.''
Coach Rohr also stressed how badly the team needs experience players, as majority of the boys under parade are young and very likely na&iuml;ve.
''We are watching and will see if he can come back. We also need experience in our team, we have so many young players.
''Again, I think they are younger than the last list so the experience of such a player could be interesting,'' the gaffer told the media after Thursday&rsquo;s press conference at the Stephen Keshi Stadium."
48,"Super Eagles gaffer and former defender of the German national team, Gernot Rohr, has implied that his dropping of certain Super Eagles star ahead of clash of the Seychelles and Egypt should be seen in the same light as him doing them a favor.
The German-born released his 23-man list days ago, but his decision to drop off some fans favorite has been nearly conceived as a criminal act by many Super Eagles supporters who by no stretch of the imagination pictured that coming.
Among the most pained exemptions were Leicester City striker, Kelechi Iheanacho, and Middleborough&rsquo;s marquee signing, John Obi Mikel.
Rohr has since come out to defend his picks and in the process noted that the reason for not including the Foxes fringe man was because of his very limited playing time.
&ldquo;Kelechi needs to play with his club. He also needs to take advantage of the international break to show his qualities to his new coach .&rdquo;
Statistically, Iheanacho has only managed on-pitch presence at an incredibly meager amount of 56 minutes of a possible 900 minutes this season in the Premier League, and coach thinks he and other stars in similar situation are in jeopardy of losing their spot.
&ldquo;I give him time but there is danger for the AFCON for those who do not play regularly in their clubs.&rdquo;
The German tactician came out with a fresh relief for Iheanacho and the likes, however, when he said the final list for the 2019 African Cup of Nations is still far from being drafted.
The veteran boss urged the lads to try to pick up strength from the disappointment and fight for a place in his team.
The Super Eagles coach also had something to say about his captain John Obi Mikel, another absentee, whose last appearance in a super Eagles jersey was in the final fixture of the 2018 World Cup.
&ldquo;He has arrived in Middleborough recently. He told me he was not ready and needs to work after his knee injury in China. He did not play all winter either. He is not ruled out of the AFCON but could not make the match in Asaba. We will see for the future.&rdquo;"
49,"Garry Southgate announced the latest Three Lions 25-man squad ahead of Euro 2020 qualifiers. However, excluding Abraham from the squad could force him to heed Nigeria Football Federation&rsquo;s call.
The squad list which was revealed on Wednesday afternoon has handed a boost to NFF who had been in long time pursuit of the Aston Villa striker on loan from Chelsea.
Abraham appeared, in September 2017, to be nearing a turn of allegiance from Three Lions to the Super Eagles when the NFF president Amaju Pinnick assured Nigerians of his close acquaintance with the striker&rsquo;s family, and promise to get him to come play for Nigeria in the 2018 World Cup.
But the 21-year old had immediately beat off claims by the NFF president and still stuck around waiting for the Three Lions call up which he eventually got in November 2017 against Germany and Brazil, two friendly matches which ended goalless.
Since then -through 2018 World Cup- till date, Abraham has not been called by England to the senior team despite his form and an incredible record of 21 goals from 30 appearances for Aston Villa in the Championship.
Abraham will again sit out this month&rsquo;s Three Lions' Euro 2020 qualification matches against Czech Republic and Montenegro.
Although he is young and still has time, but with the likes of fellow youngsters like Christian Pulisic making the rounds in both club and country, and Kylian Mbappe having already won the World Cup at 19, he could be looking to end his international speculation by agreeing to join the Super Eagles."
50,"By the end of the night, the Argentine warlord had eaten twice from the meal and dished out twice again to hungry lads who looked up to him in a feisty night of feast.
Three weeks ago, Barcelona were held to a goalless draw in France, in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16.
The big boys were prepared for a chewing and gulping binge, the night. Spit almost literally dropped out of their hanging jaws as they rallied around with so much appetite yet not even a single-goal &lsquo;bone&rsquo; was thrown at them.
Even though they did not concede a goal, it really killed them. Not only because they did not get a goal, but because they had to travel as far as interstates go, and their fans turned up in their hundreds, cheering them and singing their theme song. Pride was hurt.
Perhaps that outcome angered hungry Messi and his merryband that they decided to get the kind of result they did here tonight.
With an Andre Pirlo trademark panenka-style of play, Messi put his name on the score board by the penalty spot, then Philippe Coutinho made it two before the break.
Lyon got back into the game in the 58th minutes, refusing to be intimidated, after Lucas Tousart pulled one in, only to watch Messi extend the lead for Barcelona, seconds before the 80th minutes.
 Lionel Messi again became the man of the moment, only these times he opted in for a selfless pass for Gerard Pique to make it four, and cued in Ousmane Dembele -who came in as a substitute- for a 5-1 Lyon rip-off.
Although Messi may not have scored a hat trick like his 'doppelganger' Ronaldo did in Tuesday&rsquo;s Juve&rsquo;s triumph over Atletico Madrid, but he did what had to be done to help his team progress into the last eight."

51,"Jose Mourinho has revealed that he has, in the process of waiting for the right offer, turned down a few clubs seeking for his services.
The Portuguese international is bracing himself for a return to club coaching job, after he made it clear to the World that he prefers it to coaching national team which he termed as being too &ldquo;specific,&rdquo;
""A national team job is a very specific job - I like daily football, daily work, I like many competitons, I like many matches and I want to stay at football club level.""
The former Manchester United coach who is 56, said he knows the kind of deal he wants, particularly, a role of right &lsquo;dimension' as was his exact word, and until that comes, he does not look to settle for less.
""What I have in mind is that I would like to be back in the summer, in June, for a new club, for a new pre-season.
""I know exactly what I don't want - that's the reason I've had to say no already to three or four different offers.
""And I know what I want in terms of, not a specific club, but the nature of the job, the dimension of the job. I know what I want and I'm going to be waiting for that,"" Mourinho told beINSPORTS.
It has been two and the half month since his sacking from the Manchester United job, but the veteran coach disclosed that he has been training and preparing himself for the next job since his departure from Old Trafford."
52,"Nigeria&rsquo;s Asisat Oshoala and Equatorial Guinea&rsquo;s Jade Boho are among the nominees battling to grab the ultimate prize for week 24, in the Spanish women&rsquo;s Liga Iberdrola.
Oshoala, who plays for Barcelona, opened the score line that inspired her team to a 2-0 victory over table toppers Atletico Madrid in their home ground.
The Super Falcons' striker has enjoyed an impressive form since joining Barcelona on loan from Chinese side Dalian Quanjian, scoring five goals in five appearances so far for this season.
Guinea&rsquo;s Jade Boho, on the other hand, helped Logrono to stay off the relegation zone with an injury time victory against Madrid by scoring the all important decider goal.
Boho has been prolific in recent times and in big games, collecting a total of three goals in four consecutive matches to further her team's cause in Liga Iberdrola.
While both Oshoala and Boho will be positive about beating off competition to get the prize, fans votes are the only decider.
Beyond the prize which only accounts in personal glory, Oshoala will be hoping to help Barcelona lift Liga Iberdrola, while Boho will aim to assist her team in the fight to avoid the drop zone."
53,"Arsenal legend and two-time African player of the year, Nwankwo Kanu, has issued a warning to two Italian top dogs, Juventus and Napoli, suggesting they do not take for granted his former sides Ajax and Arsenal, in respective quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.
The Atlanta 96 gold medalist enjoyed successful spells with Ajax and Arsenal, the former with which he won UEFA Champions League, and the latter in which he was part of the &lsquo;undefeated' invincible team that lifted the English Premier League.
Following the draws which saw Ajax paired against Juventus in the Champions League, and Arsenal matched against Napoli in the Europa League, Kanu expects stark grandstand from his former teams who many consider as underdogs in the encounter.
""If Ajax play like they did against Real Madrid, it won't be easy for Juventus so let's cross our fingers and see what is going to come out from there. Ajax were unbelievable against Real Madrid.""
For Arsenal, ""We (Arsenal) are fighting for fourth place in the league and if we win the Europa League, great. With due respect to Napoli, Arsenal will give them a strong game,"" the former Super Eagles captain told sports radio Brila Fm on Tuesday.
Kanu&rsquo;s Ajax will welcome Juventus at the Amsterdam Arena on April 10th, while Arsenal will try to take advantage of receiving Napoli at the Emirates the following day."
54,"Super Eagles gaffer Gernot Rohr has said he plans to rummage through the continent provided it gets him the best suitable players to grace the Super Eagles outfit in their preparation for AFCON 2019.
Following a 3-1 victory over the Seychelles, a victory which exposed hidden flaws the Super Eagles possess, Rohr spoke specifically about adding more quality and value to the team.
''We are looking all the time to find better players, you know that we have good players that are very young. We already let two players Azubuike and Okechukwu go to the U23. They were on my list,'' relayed the German tactician.
Rohr further revealed the manner in which the regulatory body demands of partaking countries in their players call-up and selections:
''At first we will make the list of 30 players for the AFCON and then it will be reduced to 23.
''We have the time now to scout our players, to see everybody, and then I will see what I will do but we have the time now to prepare. ''"
68,"The former super eagles star who is on loan to fenerbahce from Chelsea has apologized for his below standard performance that cost his team a 2-1 loss to Istanbul Basaksehir, and has promised improvement over their next encounter.
Moses admitted that he might have underestimated the upstream nature of the Turkish League, even though their conquerors are in top form and are currently topping Super Lig.
''Naturally I'm in a process of integration, but I feel better every match. The Turkish League is definitely difficult, there are no easy encounters,'' said the Chelsea loanee.
He assured fans of an improved performance in their next game when they entertain Sivasspor on home soil, Friday.
''I know I haven't done enough yet but I want to help the team against Sivasspor. We will please our supporters who support us under all circumstances. This week will be another positive for me.''
For the sake of inadequate playing time, Moses agreed a loan move from parent club Chelsea to Fenerbahce where he is currently enjoying a fair game time, starting all four previous matches in the Super Liga."
55,"UEFA has resolved to fine the Juventus talisman 17,700 pounds, equivaling about 20,000 euros for &ldquo;crouch-grabbing&rdquo; during one of his goals&rsquo; celebrations in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16 against Atletico Madrid.
The five-time Balo&ntilde; d or winner put up the bizarre show after he managed a hat-trick that got no reply from their opponents.
The act seemed to have been a clear flout targeted at rival team&rsquo;s head coach Diego Simeone, who, prior to Ronaldo&rsquo;s, did the same celebration in the first leg when his team won at home.
Now UEFA has found Ronaldo guilty of improper conduct and has levied him the sum of 17,700 pounds, 700 pounds more than the first offender -Diego Simeone- was made to pay.
Despite the uncherished sapping from his bank account, the 34-year old will stay positive and focused, as the infraction does not put him offline or prevent him from making an appearance on 10th of April, when his team battle it out with Ajax in first leg of the UEFA Champions League Semi-finals away at Amsterdam."
56,"Trifling fissures really are necessary for sprouting new breeds of talented players to outpour onto the open pitch and, maybe, seize the moment with exquisite display, leaving the occupants of the bleachers in total awe, and the manager, especially, in the sweetest feeling of vindication for having brought out a young lad who actually worked out for the team.
The Toffees management crew certainly did open up one of those fissures for Ademola Lookman, and he obviously took it for what it&rsquo;s worth and made a huge splash of it by impressing spectators off of their seats.
But the grandstand, however, could so far get the England&rsquo;s U-20 World Cup winner only as meager as 19 appearances for Everton this season, with club gaffer Marco Silva (coming in from Watford) not particularly keen about allowing the fissure stay open for Lookman, as he, clearly, is growing tired of featuring the Super Eagles' eligible star in evidence as he opts to play Walcott or Bernard and Richarlison at the flanks instead.
If the turn of things indicates anything, it would be that Lookman may never get to best these guys (Walcott, Bernard, Richarlison) in the ultimate vie for flank role top spot, much less now that he practically warms the bench while the other mates very much partake, some in trickle, some in full.
Recalling his resum&eacute;-enriching loan spell at Leipzig the previous season, the 21-year old adorned an apparel and appeared to have looked like a kid with huge potential; like he could go on and become one of the most intrepid and deadliest wingers in modern football.
Now it would be impossible to think that the thought of jumping ship in search of greener pastures had not crossed his mind, especially as he is not getting a playing time. He is young, talented and he sits tight on the bench, something no ambitious player wants to experience.
If Lookman is ambitious enough and thinks he has got a lot of stuff to strut to the World, then forcing a move to a favorable niche (perhaps back to Leipzig) would be the ideal thing to do to save his career, as well as his hopes to cap internationally for England, or Nigeria."
57,"Middlesbrough were, on Saturday, invited to the Villa Park and whitewashed with three unreplied goals on Saturday afternoon in the English League Championship.
John Obi Mikel started and finished the agonizing match for Middlesbrough, while Tammy Abraham was unable to see of the match for Aston Villa as he picked up an injury and was subsequently replaced by Kodjia in 72th minute.
El-Ghazi and McGinn scored two first half goals for Villa to drain the morale of Tony Pulis&rsquo;s men, and late-on in the 88th minute, Adomah made it 3-0 to secure all points for the home side.
In the 52nd minute of the match, Mikel showed his frustration as he was booked for uncourteous act. The Super Eagles veteran completed his ninth appearances for Boro since his move to the club.
 Elsewhere at the Bet365 Stadium, Oghenekaro Etebo returned to Stoke City&rsquo;s starting line-up with a yellow card to his name, in their 0-0 home draw versus Reading after missing two previous Championship games on the sideline.
Etebo has scored only once for the Potters and made 26 appearances in the Championship this season.
And at the AESSAL New York Stadium, Semi Ajayi impressed for Rotterdam United, scoring the equalizer in their 2-1 loss to visitors Norwich City on Saturday afternoon.
Ajayi&rsquo;s goal cancelled out Norwich City&rsquo;s Kenny McLean&rsquo;s 45th minutes opener, before Ben Godfrey bagged the winner for Norwich City 12 minutes into the second half.
With his goal over the weekend, Ajayi has now scored in three consecutive games for Rotherham United."
58,"2-0 score line ensures Chelsea suffered a heavy defeat away to Marco silver&rsquo;s Everton in Sunday&rsquo;s English Premier League showdown at Goodison Park.
Against a goalless tie in the first half, Richarlison reacted quickly to head home a ricochet off the blues goalie -Kepa- from around six-yard box to open the score sheet, while Sigurdsson took advantage of Marcos Alonso&rsquo;s blunder in the box to make it two by converting from close range after his penalty was parried by Kepa.
Chelsea have not reacted well in the league after they narrowly scrapped out a draw last week against Wolverhampton Wonderers, and when the chips are down, they could by left kicking themselves over these let ups.
The away team had their moments earlier in the first half when Eden Hazard was first denied a goal by Jordan Pickford from a close range, and then the Chelsea man had another one when he sent a deflected shot which hit the post left of the goalkeeper.
Other unclear cut chances came in from Pedro Rodriguez and Gonzalo Higua&iacute;n but none of them could find the net.
The defeat means Chelsea are now in danger of losing a Champions League spot to either of closest rivals Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.
They are currently three points shy of Arsenal who are sitting in fourth position, and have only eight matches to go."

As it proliferated, the peoples' expressions threw the wonderful rampage into the trenches because to them, the leaders were at it again with their cock and bull crap as a justification for embezzled fund, they imagined.
Now, after a little over a year, the kingdom has unleashed more crawling minions, only this time, in Liberia&rsquo;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sending the country&rsquo;s president along with other cabinet members running for the hills.
Local reports have confirmed that the evacuation of the ministry was triggered after two black snakes were found in the building which also houses the presidency's office.
""That building's been there for years now, and [due to] the drainage system, the possibility of having things like snakes crawling in that building was high,&rdquo; Smith Toby, presidency&rsquo;s press secretary told the BBC.
""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosts the office of the president, so it did an internal memo asking the staff to stay home while they do the fumigation.""
""It's just to make sure that crawling and creeping things get fumigated from the building,&rdquo; revealed Mr. Smith.
Weah, who took over from Nobel Peace Prize-winner Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as Liberia President in December 2017 following a landslide victory, is the only African player to have won the Ballon d&rsquo;Or in 95.

From his hiring in 1996 as the manager of Manchester United to when he called time in 2013 after an unbelievable 1500 games in charge, Sir Alex had to have chewed more gums alone than the entire Manchester United supporters in the bleachers.
The legendary boss apparently chewed gums to extricate himself from the pressures and stress of the game, so then it was normal and routine, with absolutely zero chance of any becoming a memento.
But the weirdest thing happened in 2013 at the Hawthorn after Sir Alex conducted his last match as the caretaker of Manchester United in 26 year.
A fan stumbled upon a chewed, spitted gum on the ground alleged to been the same Sir Alex chomped down on during a pressure-packed 5-5 stalemate against West Brom.
The fan took it to eBay and, surprisingly, it got accepted with open listing that says:
&ldquo;Used chewing gum: RARE. Recovered from The Hawthorns. Clear Perspex/wooden case. Unofficial merchandise, rumored to belong to Sir Alex. After 1,500 games of intense chewing as manager of Man Utd, here lies Fergie&rsquo;s last piece of chewing gum. All proceeds go to the MU Foundation charity.&rdquo;
I know, right? So, while you are like- &ldquo;did it sell?&rdquo;, am like telling you it didn't only sell. The sticky throw-away mold of ball disgracedone of the best cars in the world, not to mention Plain Jane (Richard Mille's) men&rsquo;s watch, after it was sold for around &euro;395k.
So about me reinventing myself, I think I might have to start saving my unwanted toothbrushes. You never know, it might be auctionable tomorrow."

Osimhen&rsquo;s sizzling form means he has now averaged a 0.5 goals per game this season, having registered 15 goals from 30 appearances, especially considering the fact that he did not start to sore until late September last year.
20-year-old showed up with a new makeover to his hair, appearing in golden blonde. Although it took his a while to register but he did, just in the eighteenth minutes from full time, as his effort doubled Sporting Charleroi's advantage when he beat the offside trap before firing past goalkeeper Vanhamel.
The Super Eagles Under 23 forward is now the joint- highest scoring Nigerian player in the whole of Europe, level on 15 goals with FC Midtjylland's Paul Onuachu."
67,"Super Eagles forward, Odion Ighalo, has reassured Nigerians of an adventurous African Cup of Nations, urging supporters to brace up and stand firm behind the team.
The Chinese based goal specialist is not under any illusion per how big a task the 2019 Nations Cup will prove to be:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing to qualify and its another thing to go there and perform and that is what we want to do.&rdquo;
The ex Watford front man who currently plies his trade with Shanghai Shenhua, revealed some messages which have produced a cacoon of optimism to breed trust and confidence from supporters while they patiently awaiting the start of the tournament in Egypt this summer.
&ldquo;We are in good direction, we just want to continue to work hard together as a team, not to feel relaxed just because we have gotten the ticket to the AFCON&rdquo;, Ighalo said.

70,"Manchester City moved past their disappointing midweek Champions League exit to Tottenham with a knee-jerk response to scrape up all three points from a Philip Foden reaction against the same team of their nightmare, at the Etihad.
City, eyes red, was always going to push hard from the start and it did pay off -only too early- in the fifth minute with a headed reaction from young Foden, who was cued in by Aguero with an equally noggin effort.
Spurs, not keen to concede defeat, held on and soon had their moments but it was never going to materialize into something of a goal.
The brilliance of Ederson denied Son Heung-Min in the 34th minute after he fired a shot from an acute angle.
City wasted no time in going in search of a second after the restart, and Spurs were required to make a number of timely blocks to prevent shots getting through to Gazzaniga.
Spurs had an appeal for a penalty when Dele Alli&rsquo;s flick hit the arm of Kyle Walker, but the distance between the two players probably saved the right-back from gifting his former club a chance to net an equaliser.
Pep&rsquo;s men continued to terrorize the white Lilies as the game entered the final quarter, and Sterling somehow failed to convert a cross from Leroy Sane as Gazzaniga stuck out a left to prevent the ball from finding the bottom corner.
Dead in the game produced a good opportunity for drawing all level but Ederson appeared again, made himself big and denied Lucas Moura from a closed range with a block.
The North London outfit are in increased danger of slipping from top four, yet they remain in third place with four games to play ahead of the weekend&rsquo;s remaining games."

''Of course, Group D is the strongest with big opponents, including South Africa. For me, Morocco is one of the favorites to win the Cup, just like Ivory Coast, which won twice,''
''I think Egypt, which will play at home, is the number one favorite. There is also Senegal, the best African team in the FIFA rankings.
''As I said before, Morocco remains a favorite of this CAN, Tunisia too. After, I hope we too will be able to get involved in the title race,'' Rohr told Media24.
Rohr, however, still believes it is going to be a good tournament for the Super Eagles even though the games will be played in less pleasant climatic conditions, with high heat and high humidity."

Jay Jay recently spoke to News men about his decision to retired when fans least expected:
&ldquo;I must confess that [not getting a lot of playing time] was one of the main reasons why I retired from playing at a very young age...

She said aside honouring the memory of those who laid down their lives during the uprising, the commemoration was to celebrate the fact that we have the Fourth Republic because the PNDC made it possible and the PNDC was borne out of June 4 and 31st December.
Dr. Rawlings said the blood that was shed following the uprising must be a constant reminder of the ultimate price that others paid for the values and principles to be restored.
&ldquo;It is something that must serve as a memory on our conscience so that we do not lead ourselves into that situation again. The years that we have enjoyed stable constitutional rule are not by accident,&rdquo; she said.

&ldquo;I called Samuel when his mother was kidnapped and gave him my advice as someone who has been through it twice. I knew how he would be feeling. I was glad when his mother was released because you don&rsquo;t want anyone going through that.
&ldquo;I suppose these things happen every day with different families and obviously we want to see the authorities take more responsibility, but Nigeria is a very crowded place and you can&rsquo;t manage the security.""

Chelsea were delighted with the performance of Kenneth Omeruo in the last round of matches in La Liga after the Nigeria international helped goalkeeper Pichu Cu&eacute;llar to post a shutout in CD Leganes' 3-0 win against Sevilla at the Estadio Ram&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez Pizju&aacute;n.
This season is pretty much Omeruo's best season on loan at a foreign club since his arrival at Chelsea in January 2012, posing a nightmare for strikers in the competitive LaLiga Santander.
Coach Eddie Newton, Chelsea loan manager, has been keeping an eye on Omeruo as well as the official website of the Stamford Bridge outfit.
In their weekly review of their players out on loan, Chelsea's official website sang the praises of the Nigeria international:
''Kenneth Omeruo and Leganes were in fine form on Friday night, recording a shock 3-0 win away at fourth-placed Sevilla.
''Omeruo made the La Liga team of the week thanks to the performance.''
Leganes, who have 45 points from 36 games, has now guaranteed their La Liga survival thanks to their stunning win against Sevilla."

Cristiano Ronaldo must have been carried away by the euphoria of Juventus&rsquo; epic victory over Atletico Madrid which saw them overturn a 2-0 due bill incurred in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League round of 16 away to Madrid.
The Juventus star performed a double bazinga in celebration of one of his three goals where he grabbed his crouch in an apparent pay back to Diego Simeone who first performed the cojones gesture in the first leg when his team won 2-0.
The act did cost the Atletico boss a fine of around &euro;17,000, even though he explained that he only did that to show he had the courage to make tough selection decisions going into the match.
The former Manchester United player is set to undergo his own punishment for similar act as UEFA has now charged him with improper conduct.

With Alex Iwobi almost certainly guaranteed a place in the match squad, Saka and Okonkwo are a doubt for the encounter.
Saka, an England U19 winger, has not been included in the Gunners match day squad since his appearance off the bench against Blackpool in the Emirates FA Cup on January 5.

''Tammy got a whack on the shoulder. It&rsquo;s too early to diagnose. I don&rsquo;t expect him to be fit for Monday, if I&rsquo;m honest. Then we&rsquo;re hoping it&rsquo;s not too bad,'' revealed Dean Smith on Aston Villa's official website.
''He was down for a while. The doctor said that he&rsquo;d have to come off because he was in too much pain.''
The Chelsea loanee picked up the twinge just over the hour mark in Friday&rsquo;s date with Bolton Wonderers few seconds after he had notched up the record of being the first Aston Villa player to score 25 goals in a single season since 1977.

88,"The Merseyside blue delivered a TKO to an already limping Red Devils with an easy cruise at Goodison Park, while the Gunners suffered a headshot at home from Wilfred Zaha and his Crystal Palace gang, in an uncharacteristic match day fiesta.
United were still licking wounds, mulling over their traumatizing midweek Champions League blow at the hands of Messi and Barcelona when they were ambushed and finished off at route Goodison Park in a 4-0 bone crush.
Brazil wonder Richarlison opened the score sheet with a scissor kick up the roof of David De Gea from a Calvert-Lewin assist, then Gylfi Sigurdsson made sure the first half ended 2-0 with a 25-yard low shot down the right of De Gea.
At second half, Everton maintained the goal margin while United did their best to get back into the game. But with Everton netting their third before the hour mark courtesy of Lukas Digne's effort, the mojo almost immediately left the Red Devils.
To complete the score tally, Theo Walcott came in from the bench to find himself a space down the flank and then beating De Gea from eight yards to wrap it.
The result means Everton have moved into seventh position in the EPL standing, while United remain in sixth place after a third top-flight defeat in five matches.
Later in the day, Unai Emery&rsquo;s men endured a 3-2 defeat to Crystal Palace, in an interesting London derby.
Benteke provided Crystal Palace the lead in the 17th minute by heading in Luka Milivojevic cross to end his year-long goal drought from open play on his 200th Premier League appearance, before Arsenal reacted well to get on level from a Mesut Ozil&rsquo;s effort.
Zaha restored Palace the lead just after the hour mark, and a clumsy defending from the Arsenal defence gifted James McArthur a third goal for the Eagles which went on to prove the winning goal as Pierre Emerick Aubameyang pulled one back late on to cancel Zaha&rsquo;s effort.
Going into the contest, the Gunners were seeking a club-record-equalling 11th home top-flight victory in a row, but the defeat did not only end their winning home run, it also dented their all important top four hopes."
1440,"President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has launched the Rearing for Food and Jobs (RFJ) campaign, another module of his administration&rsquo;s flagship programme &ndash; &ldquo;Planting for Food and Jobs&rdquo;.  The campaign, which will run for five years, from 2019 to 2023, according to President Akufo-Addo, &ldquo;will develop a competitive and more efficient livestock industry, that will increase domestic production, reduce importation of livestock products, contribute to employment creation, and improve livelihoods of livestock value chain actors&rdquo;.  Launching the campaign on Monday, 25th June, 2019, in Wa, in the Upper West Region, the President bemoaned the steep decline of Ghana&rsquo;s livestock sector, which has been largely attributed to the high cost of production, and competition from cheap imports of livestock and its products, forcing most livestock producers to stop producing meat, and to concentrate solely on crop production.  With Ghana importing $400 million worth of meat products annually, and with local meat production accounting for only 19% of the country&rsquo;s meat requirements, President Akufo-Addo stated that these grim statistics are an indictment on the country, and that is why success has to be made of the Rearing for Food and Jobs campaign.  Towards addressing the challenges confronting the country&rsquo;s livestock industry, the President stated that RFJ will focus its attention on breed improvement, productivity and production, development of infrastructure (housing, plant and equipment, slaughtering, processing and marketing facilities), feed production and conservation of forage, animal health and disease control, development of communal grazing lands, commercialisation of livestock production and entrepreneurship development, and application of e-agriculture in livestock production.  &ldquo;By design, the campaign will cover selected value chains in the livestock sector namely, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry chicken and guinea fowl,&rdquo; he added.  With only 6 breeding farms currently in operation, as opposed to 28 in 1993, the President told the gathering that &ldquo;the breeding stations that were closed down at Wawase in the Eastern Region, Wulugu in the North East Region, Doba in the Upper east Region, Busa in the Upper West Region, and Wenchi in the Bono Region, are being revived.&rdquo;  Furthermore, he indicated that, under the RFJ programme, the Wawase cattle ranch, currently in operation in Afram Plains, which is accommodating some 3,000 cattle will be replicated in regions that experience farmer-herdsmen conflicts, or serve as corridors for the transhumance.  &ldquo;In the five-year period of the RFJ campaign, it is projected that forty thousand, five hundred (40,500) small ruminants, mainly sheep and goats, thirty eight thousand (38,000) pigs, two hundred and fifty eight thousand (258,000) cockerels, and over six hundred and sixty thousand (660,000) guinea fowls, which will not fly to Burkina Faso, will be distributed to livestock farmers and would-be farmers, throughout the country,&rdquo; President Akufo-Addo said.  He continued, &ldquo;three thousand (3,000) cattle farmers will benefit from a programme of artificial insemination to increase average meat production. These planned interventions are indicative of the important attention now being given to the livestock sector after years of neglect.&rdquo;  Farmers, who receive sheep or goat shall pay back in kind, with two offsprings per adult breeder supplied, and farmers, who receive breeding pigs, shall pay back in kind with three piglets for each breeding pig supplied.  Cockerels will be supplied to farmers at fifty per cent (50%) of the market value. Day-old chicks and guinea fowl keets will be supplied at fifty per cent (50%) subsidy to farmers, with farm capacity not exceeding two thousand (2,000) birds. Cattle farmers shall benefit from subsidised imported semen to improve the meat and milk performance of their cattle.  Components of RFJ  Towards addressing the seasonal inadequacy of feed, both in quantity and quality, the RFJ campaign will develop low-tech ways of transforming millions of tons of crop waste into millions of tons of high-quality animal feed, with potential to create an industry worth millions of cedis a year, and create thousands of jobs in Ghana.  &ldquo;To achieve this, government will procure and subsidise forage harvesting, bailing machines and equipment to enable livestock farmers conserve enough crop residue for dry season feeding of animals. Maize and soybean production, which are already being given the necessary support under the Planting for Food and Jobs initiative, will provide enough feed for the poultry at lower than usual cost,&rdquo; President Akufo-Addo added.  Whilst acknowledging that poor disease control could jeopardise the contribution of the livestock sector to food security, employment creation, and general economic development for both Ghana, the President indicated that the disease control and surveillance component of RFJ will pay heed to controlling the transmission of animal diseases, study of diseases, development of vaccines, as well as capacity building for technical expertise, and specialised skills to improve the preparedness for dealing with the challenges of outbreaks.  Also, the enhancement of the Pong Tamale Veterinary Training College, the Disease Investigation Farms in Techiman and Savelugu, and the Disease Diagnostic Laboratories in Accra, Tamale and Kumasi, will be undertaken as a matter of urgent priority.  The introduction of e-agriculture, in the RFJ campaign, the President said, will give actors of the livestock value chain access to comprehensive and up-to-date information on livestock production, market prices, disease outbreaks, farm management techniques and practices, and, above all, traceability in the livestock production sector.  In concluding, President Akufo-Addo tasked the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to ensure rapid information flow to the citizenry on how they can access the facilities pertaining to the RFJ campaign.  &ldquo;There should be effective and extensive dissemination of information on modalities of implementation of the RFJ campaign right after the launch to ensure the needed and expected participation of citizens. When that is done, the objectives of the campaign will be achieved, and the expected dividends from Government&rsquo;s investment realised,&rdquo; the President stressed."
92,"The Blues are reported to be considering making an offer to Arsenal goalkeeper, Peter Cech, in a backroom staff job when he finally retires at the end of the season.
This is part of the remodeling arrangements the Premier League giant seeks to carry out in their managerial department, and they are especially confident their legendary goalkeeper will be keen for the job.
The office to be occupied by Petr Cech is reported to be the technical director's position, one previously manned by Michael Emenalo who had left the club for Monaco in 2017, leaving the office vacant since them.
Emenalo, a squad member of the Super Eagles of Nigeria at the 1994 World Cup, spent seven massive years as the Blues technical director from 2011 heading their scouting and academy programs to great success.
Cech had enjoyed a successful stint with the Blues after joining in 2004 from Stade Rennais, winning a total of four Premier League titles and same number of FA Cup honours, the UEFA Champions League and the Europa League."

The team qualified for the 2019 FIBA World Cup for the first time since 2006 and will face Argentina, Korea and Russia in First Round Group B.
Uzoh offered an interview to FIBA basketball where he described D&rsquo;Tigers group opponents as strong teams that should not be taken for granted, but he believes the team can give them a good run for their money.
&ldquo;Hopefully this World Cup stage will be one of Nigeria&rsquo;s best experiences yet. As a unit, we like our chances,&rdquo; said Uzoh, a 1.91m (6ft 3in) playmaker who averaged 9.1 points, 4.2 assists, 4.2 rebounds and 1.3 steals in nine games during the African Qualifiers.
&ldquo;We have a competitive group of teams with respected history. No fear, just respect. Definitely, I have a ton of respect for the countries in our pool and their history but I feel we&rsquo;re a dark horse that can compete beyond the preliminaries.&rdquo;
Uzoh admits that, by reaching the Quarter-Finals at the Women&rsquo;s World Cup in Tenerife last September, Nigeria&rsquo;s women have tasked the men to not limit their ambitions.
&ldquo;A shout-out to our senior women&rsquo;s squad! Both of our success in recent years shines a greater light on Nigeria and Africa,&rdquo; Uzoh said.
&ldquo;Personally, the World Cup means a great deal to me as it&rsquo;s a stage I&rsquo;ve never been on. But any time I share the court and a stage with my brothers in representing the country, it takes on a whole greater meaning for me.
&ldquo;First off, being the No.1 team in Africa is something my brothers and I are proud of. But rather than pressure, it&rsquo;s a great opportunity that we have as a country to continue to spearhead the growth and respect of basketball on the continent.&rdquo;
On the preparations for the World Cup, Uzoh points to chemistry and preparation as a pair of key factors.
D&rsquo;Tigers will face the Dominican Republic and Canada in pre-tournament friendlies ahead of the World Cup.
&ldquo;I feel both of those will be key factors to maintain the success we had in the Qualifiers,&rdquo; Uzoh concluded."

Nigerians were left scratching their heads after Ighalo suffered an injury, which led to his substitution in the 12th minute of Shanghai Shenhua's 1-1 draw vs Tianjin Teda on Friday and it was speculated that the striker was going to miss the Africa Cup of Nations.
After tests carried out on the Super Eagles star this weekend, the injury has been classified as a hamstring problem and he is facing two to three weeks on the sidelines.
Super Eagles gaffer Gernot Rohr will have every cause to feel relieved given the news, as there is nothing to worry about Ighalo whose participation in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations is still within the time frame for his recovery and his return date if he does not suffer a relapse.

The Chelsea winger, who is currently doing time on loan at Fenerbahce previously called it a quit to his international career after the 2018 World Cup, citing the need to focus on his family and career at the Stamford Bridge outfit.
The Nigeria Football Federation President, Amaju Pinnick and coach Gernot Rohr have attempted to convince Moses to make a return to the senior national team without any luck.
Reports alleged that the main reason for Moses's ditching of the Super Eagles was because his families had discouraged him from playing for Nigeria again, that most of the players are involved in fetish practices.
Furthermore, the 28-year-old is wary of suffering an injury while on international duty and his parents have also pointed out that the players competing for his position could deliberately hurt him in practice sessions.
Moses was a key member of the Nigeria squad that won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa and represented the country in the World Cup two times."
98,"The 19-year-old&rsquo;s dribbling skills and ability to cut-in from the edge of the box to aim at goal and produce assists are some of the reasons Villarreal is crawling out of the relegation zone.
It may not be as much goals and assists as Christiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi would get you in as many appearances but for his age and experience, Samuel Chukwueze is definitely up there as one of the most highly rated teens in the Spanish La Liga.
The youngster has has been actively involved in seven league goals (5 goals and 2 assists) since his debut with the Yellow Submarine, and his goals are very influential in their desire to beat the drop before the end of the season.
This season which has been a near disappointment for Villarreal who found themselves in relegation troubles during the opening half of the campaign.
The clubs board had sought to fix the situation by firing manager Javier Calleja, replacing him with Luis Garcia. Due to poor results Garcia was also fired in less than two months, Calleja was re-hired and that&rsquo;s when things started to turn around for the Yellow Submarines.
Coach Calleja maybe the major reason things are turning around for Villarrea, however, Super Eagles winger Samuel Chukwueze equally deserves more accolades than what he's getting from the club's supporters.
His introduction into the club's first-team brought spark to the attacking department that was far from impressive in the opening months of the season.

Chukwueze, who is considered one of the brightest young stars in Europe, has been impressive for Villarreal this season, scoring eight goals in 36 matches.
The attacker is valued high around 58 million pounds by the Yellow Submarine but with his age and promising abilities, either of the English teams maybe well ready to activate the buy out fee.

Hakim Ziyech slipped the ball through for Donny van de Beek, who controlled the pass and converted past Hugo Lloris after taking some time to compose himself.
The Dutch side were well on top when opening the scoring and came closest to scoring the second goal of the night through David Neres&rsquo;s shot in the second half, which came back off the post.
Tottenham did have spells on top after switching from a three-man defence to four at the back, but they managed just one shot on target across the 90 minutes and now have it all to do in next week&rsquo;s return fixture in Amsterdam.
Going into the match, Mauricio Pochetinno made four changes from his side&rsquo;s 1-0 loss to West Ham United here at the weekend, reverting to a three-man defence made up entirely of former Ajax players.
It was the current Ajax crop who started the match on top, soon finding their groove and deservedly edging in front through the first serious attacking move of the match.
Tottenham&rsquo;s supporters were starting to grow a little agitated as Ajax created another good opportunity five minutes later, but Van de Beek was this time denied by Lloris at his near post when he had the option to return the ball to Dusan Tadic in a better position.
Pochettino changed shape following his side&rsquo;s slow start and that paid off as Fernando Llorente and Toby Alderweireld headed over the crossbar, either side of the home side losing Jan Vertonghen to a nasty facial injury.

The former Chelsea player has not appear in any of Nigeria&rsquo;s six games in the qualifiers prompting speculations that he might have decided to quit international football.
Rohr, however, was swift to clear the air with an exclusive interview covered by Osasu Obayiuwana:
&ldquo;This is the question that I and my team will resolve. I will soon go to see him at @Boro. There are many things to consider but I respect him and what he has done for Nigeria. He remains an important player,&rdquo; the gaffer told the journalist.
&ldquo;He has been away from the team for a year but we qualified for the AFCON without him. His absence, as our captain, has been evident. But he has had to deal with a range of issues, after the World Cup in Russia.&rdquo;

&ldquo;He is a great talent and I would like him in my team, although I don&rsquo;t know if he will be an immediate starter. The challenge, of course, is that he is also wanted for Nigeria&rsquo;s @fifau20 team going to Poland.
&ldquo;&hellip; I have had a chat with the coach of Villarreal and they don&rsquo;t want him to exhaust himself at the U-20 WC and the AFCON, so they want him to choose one tournament. We shall see how best we can manage this situation. But no doubt, he&rsquo;s a talent for my team.&rdquo;"

Nigerians expected so much from him due to his rich vein of form which saw him score plenty of goals prior to his maiden call-up the camp.
Unfortunately, Nwakaeme didn't live up to his billing during Nigeria's 1-1 draw (later forfeited) with Algeria which was his debut game for the West African side.
He struggled to get past his markers on countless occasions and he also missed a glorious opportunity to give the Eagles a much deserved lead.
Having failed to grab his opportunity with both hands, Nwakaeme hasn't returned to the team for more than a year as competition for places in Rohr's team continue to increase steadily.
However, this season has been a very productive one for the center-forward cum winger who looks rejuvenated since his switch to Turkish giant Trabzonspor.
After an impressive run of form that has seen him score 10 goals from 23 league matches, it would not be undeserved if, perhaps, coach Gernot Rohr decides to give him another chance before the AFCON tournament in Egypt to prove his attacking prowess with the three-time African Champions."

The Blaugrana have made Villarreal winger Chukwueze their top target this summer in the event that Coutinho departs the Camp Nou.
The 19-year-old Nigerian winger commands a transfer fee in the region of 60 million euros and is also on the radar of Premier League duo Liverpool and Manchester City.
Villarreal are hoping to offer Chukwueze a new deal but little progress has been made as he doesn't want his market value to increase.
The highly rated teenager has scored 8 goals for Villarreal's first team this season, including his strike against Barcelona last month."
131,"Chelsea will be hoping they do not sit out two whole season&rsquo;s worth of transfer imposed on them by the regulation body -FIFA, but should that be the case, part of the manager contingency plan would be to recall some of their most in-form players on loan.
The highly sizzling Tammy Abraham is reportedly set to be part of Maurizio Sarri's team next season, should FIFA's transfer ban remains unchanged.
The West London club are in danger of be being rendering ineligible to sign new players in the next two transfer windows after breaching FIFA's transfer rules and regulations, which means that Sarri will make use of his current crop of players and some standout loanees throughout next season.
According to the Sun, Nigeria-eligible striker Tammy Abraham, who scored 25 League goals for Aston Villa this season, and France International Kourt Zouma are going to remain at Stamford Bridge all through the next season.
Though it is understood that Aston Villa will make a permanent bid for the England's striker if they return to Premier League, the Blues hierarchy are poised to seeing the former Bristol City man at West London next season even if it means rejecting all offers for his signature."
132,"Samuel Chukwueze has lifted the lid on his failed moved to Arsenal, adding that he dreams of playing in the English Premier League in the near future.
The winger had already passed a medical conducted by Arsenal doctors back in the summer of 2016, but the Gunners' refusal to pay a large percentage of the transfer fee resulted in the break down of the deal.
Had it materialize, Arsenal would have paid Diamond Academy 2.5 million pounds for the services of Samuel Chukwueze, including performance-related add-ons.
The Gunners had agreed a &pound;1.5 million transfer fee and the Nigerian club would have pocketed &pound;500,000 when he breaks into the first team plus an extra &pound;500,000 when he makes his first appearance for the Super Eagles.
''It was very close for me to sign for Arsenal, almost had the contract in my hands,&rdquo; Chukwueze told Tribalfootball.com:
""Unfortunately, it did not work out fine with my academy due to the side of agreement and payment. They did not agree with the terms of the contract.
""I was very happy thinking of signing and dreaming of playing for Arsenal, but my academy did not allow it to happen. I kept on pushing and praying to get a club in Europe and it came with Villarreal.""
The Villarreal starlet added: ''Playing in England is still an ambition for me.
""I need to keep on working hard and to keep improving. I really want to play in England. I think so."""
133,"Coach of Nigeria national team, Gernot Rohr, has confirmed that Samuel Kalu still remains in contention to feature for the national team at the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations amid media speculation the winger has been ruled out of action for the rest of the season.
Kalu withdrew from the Nigeria games against Seychelles and Egypt due to hamstring which has him forced out for close to eight weeks now, but the Bordeaux number 10 is back in solitary training.
Aside from injury blow, the former Gent star earlier had a rather traumatizing days which caused him sleepless nights when his mother was kidnapped.
The player&rsquo;s troubled state notwithstanding, coach Rohr puts faith in seeing more of his promising player.
''He's doing better even though this story (the kidnapping of his mother) physically exhausted him because he did not sleep for a week, and he'll be back in the group soon,'' Rohr told Goal.com .

134,"Eintracht Frankfurt&rsquo;s forward, Luka Jovic, have completed a &euro;60m (&pound;52.4m) move to Real Madrid according to reports emanating from Sky Sports News.
The 21-year-old has agreed a five-year contract worth approximately &pound;165,000 per week to move to the Bernabeu and will provide competition to Karim Benzema in Real&rsquo;s attack.
Jovic is now Real&rsquo;s second major signing of the summer after they initially completed a deal for Porto and Brazil centre back Eder Militao in March for a reported fee of &euro;50m (&pound;42.7m).
Frankfurt only signed Jovic on a permanent basis last month when they activated a purchase option in his two-year loan agreement, buying him from Benfica for just &euro;12m.
The Bundesliga side have therefore made a huge profit off the Serbia international, although Sky reports that Benfica will be due a cut of the fee worth around &pound;10.5m due to a sell-on clause.
Jovic has been in sensational form this season for Frankfurt, scoring 27 goals in 47 games in all competitions, including ten in the Europa League with The Eagles defying expectations to reach the semi-final stage."

One minute into first-half stoppage time, the former Arsenal striker beat the keeper with a semi-bicycle kick.
Unlike in the first half, both teams had few chances in the second half and PAOK held on to win their first double in Greece.
Akpom went on and was named the most Valuable Player of the Greek Cup final.
The 23-year-old ended the 2018-2019 season with eight goals in 33 appearances in all competitions.

Osimhen has scored one goal more than FC Midtjylland's Paul Onuachu, who is the second highest rated Nigerian player with 25.5 points.
With the 25-man list out and still needing two players to be dropped, the striker might well be on his way to making the final 23-man list for the AFCON tournament with his deadly form."

Moses produced the game winner in the 59th minute from the penalty spot, and that was enough for the Yellow Canaries to take all the three points from the home team who would not let go of the match without some real fight.
Former Real Madrid and Spurs striker, Soldado, got the penalty when he went down in the area after he was allegedly brought down by goalkeeper Ibrahim Semic, and referee Arslanboga, after consulting VAR, deemed the challenge bad enough to be worthy of a dead-ball kick.
The goalkeeper remained rooted to the spot when Moses stylishly converted the penalty and he celebrated his goal with a somersault, then paid tribute to fictional superhero Batman.

He was that player. But he was also a player with prolific integrity. Not only at home with the Eagles, but abroad too in England where he built a record of 95 Premier League goals fortress in only as many 252 appearances, way more than any other Nigerian player, past or present, has scored.
The 36-year-old goals record could soon be broken considering the rate at which young and quality goalscorers continue emerge in the country.
One player who has been sighted with all the qualities yet little or no side effects of the former Middlesbrough and Everton striker is Everton loanee Henry Onyekuru, who is currently blazing hot in front of goal for Galatasary.
The 21-year-old looks as good as Yakubu when it comes to converting goalscoring opportunities, hence, he can become the next Nigerian to paint Premier League with many goals.
Yet a minor glitch ensures the prospect is having a hard time getting a work permit in England.
But with his form raising brows among onlookers, the merseyside Blue will surely put more work alongside the winger&rsquo;s effort to sort out the work permit this summer, and perhaps Marco Silva will find him worthy of a chance in the Premier League next season."

The Flying Eagles could not string five passes together in the friendlies and in training games, and the main problem with the team is that they are hardly able to create chances, not to mention scoring.

Over at the camp of Super eagles, the news from Sousa will surely be one to celebrate over, as Kalu has been named in the country's provisional roster for the Africa Cup of Nations squad despite concerns over his fitness.
In the last four months, the former Gent star has logged only 216 minutes in the Ligue 1 due to a hamstring injury he had been dealing with.

The President, Nana Akufo-Addo, launched Ghana's digital property address system onOctober 18, 2017.
The system which is basically for easy navigation will help in reducing the difficulties in locating people and properties across the country.
It is a global addressing system which uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to divide Ghana into grids of 5m x 5m squares and assigns each one a unique address.
It has an application which will allow Ghanaians to validate their home and business addresses in order to create a national address registry for easy direction and identification purposes.
It was designed by Vokacom, a Ghanaian information technology firm, with the National Information Technology Agency (NITA) hosting the data.
With this system, every land and property in Ghana including undeveloped parcels of land gets a permanent address.

""Talking about the AFCON in Egypt, there are so many good teams that will be at the Nations Cup. Nigeria can win it just like any other country. It will be difficult with 24 teams playing time around.
""I cannot say this team or that team will win this tournament but we know that whenever Egypt hosts the AFCON, they win it.
""Its just in the history of the tournament, they may win or not win but honestly the team that will win the AFCON must be mentally strong because there are so many good teams this year. It will be difficult,"" El Hadji Diouf stressed.

''We have them (strikers) but we have to drop one of them. Don't forget that we have wingers who can play as fullbacks like we did against South Africa with Kalu who was on the right side, right fullback and a winger the same time,'' Rohr said at a press conference on Thursday.
''When we play 3-5-2 like we did against Iceland at the World Cup or we did in South Africa, there's also a possibility for Simon Moses to play like he did in his club, on the left side, so we have full backs which is also very good to know tactically.

''It is good for me but it is sometimes difficult for me to choose players. But I'm happy to have this good quality, so let's go with offensive spirit to the AFCON because we want to win our games.''

""It will not be so easy in such a context to score many goals. They know how to defend well. It will take intelligence and creativity and build on the side"", said the former Gabonese gaffer.
Having already booked a spot in the African Cup of Nations tournament set to go down in Egypt, with 10 points from five games to conveniently stay atop group E, Rohr does not think his boys will be feeling complacent going into the match.
""There is a state of mind and a group that has won almost all three games since the 2018 World Cup. We have the ambition to retain the lead of group E with a win.""
Meanwhile, the Seychelles side will be hoping to put the reverse fixture behind them, and concentrate on drawing strength from a positive goalless draw they managed to squeeze out against South Africa and use it as a means to channel more energy into the all important game against Nigeria and try to get something from the encounter."

The group, Economic Fighters League, that has also been pushing the #DropThatChamber campaign, said it wants the legislative body to completely cancel that idea.
After heightened opposition by many Ghanaians to the idea, Parliament on Monday put on hold plans to put up the 200 million dollar 450-seater capacity complex.

Mr. Yeboah said they expect a much more solid assurance from parliament on the matter.
&ldquo;Putting it on hold, so that it is brought back? We want it dropped. We don&rsquo;t even want them to discuss it.

The former Chelsea midfielder pointed out that the Super Eagles won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa because they were well drilled before the start of the tournament.

 ''Well, I think obviously fitness is going to play a big part in this tournament, it always does when it comes to African football, fitness always plays 80 percent part in who wins the tournament.
''If you look back at 2013 when we won it, we were one of the fittest teams, we were well drilled, we put in the hard work during the camp, we knew exactly what we were doing. We were really fit.
''That's what we are doing now, training twice a day. If you want to win this trophy you have to do things like that.
''I am happy that every player in this team want to do it, we want to achieve the same thing, we want to be in the finals and win the tournament but we also need to know we are not the outright favorite, we have to remain cool, calm, just do what we have to do, not look at other teams.
''If we do that, we'll keep winning games. Experience also plays a big part, sometimes youthfulness also plays a big part.
''We have got a very good mixture in this team that's going to help us. We have a very young team, they are all fit''.

But it is good for us that we started the competition very well,&rdquo; Aigbogun stated during his interaction with reporters after the game.

''We are not happy when we see... the three highest goalscorers in the English Premier League, they are Africans, no Nigerian. To me it is strange,'' said Pinnick to Channels TV.

The Super Eagles captain&rsquo;s all round response to questions were desirable and, at the very list, quite a taste, but his most interesting response was when he was asked to choose between Ronado and Messi, who both have shared a combined ten Ballon d'Or awards.

''Messi all day. For me, he is from a different planet.
''I'm grateful to have been able to play with him, from U20s we started playing against each other, played against him so many times''.

Allegiance apart, the Blues legend naturally hinted he preferred Chelsea to Arsenal and admitted he values trophy over money, but for wears, corporates over casuals were pretty much his forte."

1460,"African leaders will decide on Sunday which nation will host the headquarters for a continental free-trade zone that aims to eventually unite the continent&rsquo;s 1.27 billion people and its $3.4 trillion nominal gross domestic product.  Leaders at the African Union summit in Niger will also set a date for trading to begin in the African Continental Free Trade Area, a deal that 52 of the continent&rsquo;s 55 states have signed, although only 25 have ratified it. The bloc aims to ultimately remove trade barriers and tariffs between members.  WHICH COUNTRIES WANT THE HEADQUARTERS?  Under the Addis Ababa-based African Union&rsquo;s rules, all of its 55 members may bid to host the headquarters. Kenya, Ghana, eSwatini, Madagascar and Egypt are all in the race. Ethiopia and Senegal have pulled out.  Those in the race represent the continent&rsquo;s main regions: Kenya from the east, Ghana from the west, eSwatini for southern Africa, Madagascar for the Indian Ocean islands and Egypt representing the north.  Egypt holds the AU presidency this year and has been promoting itself as a linchpin for African trade.  &ldquo;Egypt is one of the oldest members of the African Union and enjoys strong relations with African states,&rdquo; said an official from Egypt&rsquo;s trade ministry. &ldquo;We have all the requirements.&rdquo;  WHAT ARE THEIR CHANCES?  Kenya and Egypt already host head offices for other international bodies and are well connected by established national airlines.  Kenya hosts the headquarters of the U.N. agencies for the environment and for urban development: UNEP and UN-Habitat. Egypt hosts the headquarters of the Africa Export Import Bank.  &ldquo;Nairobi is a very natural location for such a body. It is easy to reach any part of this continent (from here),&rdquo; Peter Munya, the Kenyan minister of trade, told reporters.  Tiny eSwatini, formerly known as Swaziland, has secured the backing of its regional trade bloc, the Southern African Development Community (SADC).  WHY DOES IT MATTER?  Whoever hosts the headquarters gains prominence and prestige. The winning country will also secure jobs for citizens at the secretariat, and get a cash boost to its travel and tourism industries.  The African Union wants to boost annual intra-continental trade to 25-36 percent of all African commerce within five years, from just 18 percent currently, and attract large, long-term investments from firms like global carmakers.  &ldquo;Hosting the (headquarters) would ensure that eSwatini becomes Africa&rsquo;s commercial hub. The country will become a hive of business activities,&rdquo; Mancoba Khumalo, eSwatini&rsquo;s minister of commerce and trade, told local media.  WHAT NEXT?  After African Union heads of states and governments pick the host country on Sunday, they will unveil regulations governing issues like trade liberalisation, rules of origin, removal of non-tariff barriers and the development of a payments and settlements system.  They will also set a date for trading to start in the bloc. The deadline should allow time for firms to make adjustments and states to prepare new trade documents.  Nigeria, the continent&rsquo;s biggest economy, said this week it will sign up on Sunday.  The bloc must figure out how to avoid member states exporting or smuggling raw material outside the continent that was traded tariff-free under the guise of intra-African trade, said Anzetse Were, a Kenyan development economist.  &ldquo;Given Africa&rsquo;s underdeveloped manufacturing and propensity to export raw commodities, without co-ordinated policy change, the (bloc) may entrench and enable this dynamic,&rdquo; she said.  WILL THE BLOC WORK? Past attempts at economic integration have created an alphabet soup of competing and overlapping trade zones - ECOWAS in the west, EAC in the east, SADC in the south and COMESA in the east and south.  Albert Muchanga, the AU&rsquo;s commissioner for trade and industry, said implementation &ldquo;will be very, very difficult but I think we have the capacity&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The status quo is not good for Africa. You have got 55 fragmented states, which traditionally are small and weak in the global system,&rdquo; he told Reuters by phone.  But the continent had a combined $3.4 trillion gross domestic product, he said.  &ldquo;As long as we maintain the status quo, Africa really will have very low development prospects.&rdquo;  "
203,"Super Eagles of Nigeria played host to Zimbabwe at the Stephen Keshi Stadium but things were not as good as predicted by many soccer-loving Nigerians prior to the encounter.

204,"Nigeria manager Gernot Rohr has announced his final 23-man roster for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations which begins in Egypt on June 21, according to a report.
The 23 players selected come from the 25-man provisional roster earlier invited to attend a training camp in the Delta State capital Asaba.
Leicester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho and Rotherham United central defender Semi Ajayi are the players axed by the German football tactician.
There was a hint that both English-based players were not in the plans of Rohr after they were not handed a run-out in the goalless draw against Zimbabwe on Saturday.
John Obi Mikel, Chelsea duo Kenneth Omeruo and Ola Aina, Arsenal's Alex Iwobi, goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa and eighteen other players will be on the plane to Ismailia few hours from now.
The Super Eagles players and officials were due to depart Asaba this morning but there was a sudden change of travel plans and they will now depart at 1500 hours.
The players have just arrived the Stephen Keshi Stadium for a recovery session ahead of their trip to Egypt.

205,"Coach of the national team of Nigeria, Gernot Rohr, has insisted that the Super Eagles performed well in their pre-Africa Cup of Nations friendly against Zimbabwe on Saturday despite the unfavorable weather conditions.
The Super Eagles laboured to a goalless draw at home to the Warriors but Rohr has picked out a few positives from the game - the return of Mikel and the clean sheet posted by goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi.
''There was so much rain but we had to adapt to these conditions and I think it won't be the same in Egypt normally. It will be dry and hot,'' Rohr told reporters at the post-match press conference.
''For the first time in Nigeria, I was cold on the sidelines and I had to jump. All the players that played deserve congratulations because it is not easy to play good football in these conditions but they tried.
''They did well, had opportunities to score a goal, we did not. Today our objective was to reintegrate our captain, not to concede a goal, the foundation must be solid which was the case in the defense.
''Some of our players are missing like Ndidi, like Shehu, like Ekong first half, Musa. I am very happy about this match because it was a good test for us.''
The Super Eagles held a recovery session at the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba on Sunday morning ahead of their trip to Egypt."
206,"Chelsea fullback Ola Aina provided an assist for Torino in their 3-1 victory against Lazio on the final day of the Italian Serie A season on Sunday afternoon.
The Nigeria international delivered a long throw-in which found Iago Falqu&eacute; who then volleyed past goalkeeper Silvio Proto to give The Maroons the lead just five minutes into the second half.
According to the regulations, an assist is awarded for a pass leading directly to a goal and this applies equally to corner kicks and throw-ins.
Aina was also credited with assists against Sampdoria (November 4) and Frosinone Calcio (March 10), and netted his only goal of the season against Udinese in February.
The Chelsea-owned defender joined Torino on a season-long loan in August with an option to buy for ten million euros at the end of the season but it remains to be seen if the Turin outfit will execute the option as Chelsea have been slapped with a two-window transfer ban by Fifa after breaching rules in relation to the signing of youth players.
Aina would take a little breather and then report to Nigeria for international duty in Asaba ahead of the Super Eagles trip to Egypt for the Africa Cup of Nations."
253,"Europa League winners Chelsea are prepared to part company with Nigeria international Kenneth Omeruo in the summer transfer window, provided an interested club meet their asking price.
A known media in Spain has reported that Chelsea have turned down a bid of four million euros from CD Leganes for the Super Eagles star because it did not meet their valuation.
It will take in the region of six million euros to convince The Blues to sell the center back who arrived Stamford Bridge from Sunshine Stars in 2012.
The 25-year-old's priority is to remain at CD Leganes after an outstanding season in which he played 31 games in all competitions.
Though Leganes want to sign Omeruo on a permanent deal, he is also on the radar of Spanish and German clubs.
He previously enjoyed loan spells at ADO Den Haag, Middlesbrough, Kasimpasa and Alanyaspor."
207,"Nigeria Football Federation President, Amaju Pinnick has revealed that it will cost N3.5 million (approximately US$9,800.00) to purchase a flight ticket for Mikel Obi's trip to Asaba for the national team's pre-Africa Cup of Nations training camp.
The football administrator went on to say that the Nigerian Federation have to spend approximately N70 million as traveling expenses for the foreign-based professionals called up to the training camp which begins on Sunday, June 2 in the Delta State capital.
''It is not a hidden document, we have a budget of about N1 billion every year but what is backed by cash is 65 percent which comes to about N650 million,'' Pinnick told Channels Television.
''But let me give you an example, when the Super Eagles are playing a game the minimum it costs is N200-250 million.
''Now this morning, they sent a memo to me for the players that they invited. Mikel Obi's ticket alone is N3.5 million, it is normal, Ighalo's own is above N4 million. If you put all these together, you are talking about N60-70 million alone for their coming.
''Then you talk about daily allowances, you talk about bonuses, accommodation, match organization, referees indemnity and you are dealing with 13 national teams.''
Mikel is making a return to the Super Eagles following a self imposed sabbatical after the 2018 World Cup in Russia."
208,"Sporting Charleroi and Nigeria international striker Victor Osimhen has broken a record held by Imoh Ezekiel after scoring the quickest goal in the history of the Belgian First Division A on Sunday, May 26.
The Wolfsburg loanee took only 8.15 seconds to open the scoring in Sporting Charleroi's 3-2 loss to Antwerp at the Bosuilstadion (Deurne), surpassing the previous record set by Ezekiel on on August 11, 2013 after 10.8 seconds for Standard against Racing Genk.
Osimhen took advantage of a mix-up in the Antwerp defense, latched onto a loose ball and burst into the penalty area before firing a right footed shot past goalkeeper Sinan Bolat.
Prior to today's game, Osimhen had been already been crowned the winner of the Nigerian Golden Shoe and his strike against Antwerp took his tally for the season to 19 league goals.
With the striker's loan spell at Sporting Charleroi coming to an end, his future is expected to dominate the foreign and local press in the summer transfer window, and he could put himself in the shop window if he is included in the Super Eagles 23-man squad for the Africa Cup of Nations."
209,"2013 Africa Cup of Nations-winning defender Godfrey Oboabona, 28, has departed Croatian top flight club HNK Gorica following the expiration of his contract.
Oboabona joined Gorica as a free agent in September 2018 and recorded 14 appearances for the club in the league, logging 1,214 minutes.
''Thanks to everyone in the club who was with me and took care of my stay here in Velika Gorica and beautiful Croatia would be as enjoyable as possible,'' Oboabona said to Gorica's official website.
''I am grateful for all the attention and I hope the next season for Gorica will be even better. Everyone will stay in my heart and in a nice memory.''
A product of Rising Stars, Oboabona began his career abroad with Rizespor in Turkey before transferring to Al-Ahli Jeddah in 2017.
He was an influential figure in the Super Eagles side that won the 2013 AFCON, starting and going the distance in all their six matches during the tournament in South Africa.

The Slovenians were trailing 2-0 at the interval after Oshoala got on the scoresheet in the 18th and 26th minute.
Although the Super Falcons showed their superiority in the second half, they had to wait until the 91st minute before extending their lead through American-based striker Uchenna Kanu.
Dennerby made a rash of substitutions in the second half with as many as seven players entering into the fray, including Chinwendu Ihezuo, Uchenna Kanu, Chinaza Uchendu, Anam Imo, Evelyn Nwabuoku, Rasheedat Ajibade and Amarachi Okoronkwo.
Nigeria begin their campaign at the World Cup against Norway on June 8, then it is South Korea on June 12 and hosts France on June 17."
211,"Gernot Rohr has praised super eagles captain, Obi Mikel, after the midfielder arrived early to the national team's get-together in Asaba.
The Super eagles coach said that Mikel has showed commitment to contribute to the team's success at the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations.
''Mikel has at all times been a professional and the fact that he arrived here early means that he is very committed to do well and to lead us,'' Rohr said.
''We expect 25 players here but some of them cannot come in today because they had games&ndash; like Ighalo came yesterday from China &mdash; Alex Iwobi is also being expected.
''So, the team will be complete in two days but already 18 players have arrived here in Asaba.
''Training will start immediately today to get our players ready.''
The number 10 has not played for the Super Eagles since he went the distance in the 2-1 loss to Argentina on June 26,2018 and there were fears that he had called time on his international career.
The Super Eagles will be having two training sessions on Monday, with the morning and evening workout starting 1000 hours and 1645 hours respectively."
213,"Torino have decided to make use of the purchase option inserted into Ola Aina's contract when he joined the Turin based club on a season-long loan from Chelsea, according to president Urbano Cairo.
The club revealed that Ola Aina's permanent switch could be finalized on Monday, May 27, provided that Chelsea are ready to accept their offer for the wing back.
FIFA have banned Chelsea from signing players for two transfer windows after they were found guilty of breaching the rules in connection with minors and it is being speculated that The Blues do not want to sell the Nigeria international again as a result of the ban.
''Ola Aina? He did well, tomorrow I will send the letter to Chelsea to communicate that we will exercise the right to purchase, '' Cairo told Sky Sport Italia.
Aina did enough to earn a permanent move to Torino, playing 30 games (22 as a starter) in the Serie A and scoring one goal while providing three assists.
The 22-year-old signed for Chelsea as an U11 and has played six games for their first team."
214,"Udinese&rsquo;s William Troost-Ekong hopes his Italian club Udinese will have a better campaign next term after they fought hard to escape relegation.
The Italian club ended their 2018/2019 campaign on a winning note, edging out their hosts Cagliari 2-1 at the Sardegna Arena.
Having fought hard to beat the drop for the major parts of the season, Udinese finished in a respectable 12th position in the table with 43 points from 38 games.
&ldquo;Great victory and great battle to finish the season well. Thank you for your support! On this we will build next year. #FORZAUDINESE,&rdquo; Troost-Ekong tweeted.
The Nigeria international made 35 league appearances for Udinese and was cautioned four times.
The 25-year-old is now expected to rest for few days before linking up with his international teammates for the camping exercise in Asaba on Sunday for the 2019 Africa of Nations in Egypt."
215,"Former Nigeria international and Chelsea legend Celestine Babayaro played under world class managers during his illustrious playing career and has rated Portuguese gaffer Jose Mourinho as the best of the lot.
The left-back was signed from Anderlecht for a club-record fee as a teenager in 1997, Netherlands legend Ruud Gullit was in the dugout when he first arrived Chelsea, before he was managed by Gianluca Vialli, Ray Wilkins and Jose Mourinho.
''I was fortunate to have a great career with Chelsea, I spent eight years with Chelsea, played under Ruud Gullit, Gianluca Vialli, Claudio Ranieri and Jose Mourinho,'' said Babayaro to Nigeria Info FM.
''Jose got into Chelsea in 2004 when Abramovich took over Chelsea. I had a fantastic time with Jose, I only had a year with Jose.
''Jose, like he called himself the special one, was brilliant. He opened my eyes to a lot of things in football, the man is down to details especially if it comes to training.
''He's one of a kind, for me, Jose is the best coach I've ever played for.''
Babayaro played under Graeme Souness, Glenn Roeder and Sam Allardyce at Newcastle United, while he worked with Philippe Troussier, Bora Milutinović, Shuaibu Amodu, Thijs Libregts and Jo Bonfr&egrave;re at international level.
Mourinho, who has been unemployed since departing Manchester United in December 2018, has won the league titles in Portugal, Spain, England and Italy."
216,"Zimbabwe national team coach Sunday Chidzambwa has picked Chelsea legend John Obi Mikel and Arsenal winger Alex Iwobi as two of the outstanding players in the Super Eagles ranks.
The gaffer believes there are other players to keep an eye on but described the two players as different from the rest.
''There are very good players in the team, the likes of Iwobi, Mikel. They have youngsters, they have a very good team and they stand a chance in the final,'' he said.
''Both countries want to qualify. On our part we will try to get past the group stages, since we started this AFCON campaign we haven't gone past the group stages but we are going to try to get past the group stages.
''I think the Super Eagles are in an easier group, they are seeded too and with their play they will be able to go past the group stages.''
"
217,"The winger has suggested that Chelsea icon Obi Mikel will likely be deployed as a central midfielder at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
Nigeria manager Gernot Rohr has been trying out different formations in the training sessions and gave a hint at what his starting line-up against Burundi could be in the preparatory matches against Zimbabwe and Senegal.
Both Iwobi and Mikel lined up in midfield in both matches with the Hale End Academy product deployed in a more advanced position and the Super Eagles captain playing centrally.
''It's great to have Mikel back, with so much experience and what he has done for the country, what he done for Chelsea, especially to have him in the base of midfield,'' Iwobi said in an interview with Super Eagles Media team.
''To have him there, he's always talking to me, tries to help me with my game because the conditions in Europe and Africa are different. He is always there to help me and guide me when I'm playing.''
According to Iwobi, the Super Eagles play as a team and are not reliant on one player to get the job done.
''Even though we have stars we do work hard as a team, we don't rely on one person. We have so many players, we attack as a team and defend as a whole team.
''Collective performance, that's what we focus on and that's what brought to us where we are and why we've been doing well recently.''"

&ldquo;This is a special Nations Cup. We have missed two editions and that means the whole of the continent will be looking on to us to redeem our image. So we cannot afford to fail. The last time we were there we left as champions in 2013, so this is the first opportunity to take part in the competition for many of us,&rdquo; he said to Stoke Sentinel.
Etebo also knows it&rsquo;s not only Nigerians that will be looking up to him and his colleagues to deliver in Egypt.
&ldquo;I know a number of my teammates and management of my club will be looking up to me to do well on the international stage atthe Africa Cup of Nations,&rdquo; said the 23-year-old.
Etebo hails Stoke City for providing him the enabling environment to thrive in his first season at the club.
&ldquo;Stoke is a fantastic club and they make you feel at home at every point in time. After our last game, I was put on the spot and celebrated as a send-off to the Africa Nations Cup. They are happy that I&rsquo;m going to Egypt and playing in the colours of Nigeria.&rdquo;
The Nigerian has also assured the Potters&rsquo; supporters to disregard transfer speculations around him.
Eye-catching performances towards the end of the season led to whispers he could head for a higher level but he said, in an interview for The National:
&ldquo;It is still early now to talk about that. I have a good relationship with Stoke and I am happy there.&rdquo;
Etebo added:
&ldquo;At the end of the day I was adjudged the Stoke City player of the year (by the south west supporters&rsquo; club) and I must thank the club for that support. It is really inspiring and a good mentality to take to the Nations Cup.&rdquo;"
219,"Rita Chikwelu has suggested that the midfield battle will be key to whether they win or lose their final Group A match against France at the 2019 Women's World Cup.
The Kristianstad ace shone playing as a deep-lying midfielder as Nigeria registered a 2-0 win against South Korea on Wednesday and she has admitted that the French team will be tougher opponents.
''It is not going to be an easy game, everybody knows that, we are going there to fight to get a point,'' Chikwelu told media team.
''It is going to be a physical game in midfield, we know their midfielders, likewise they know us. We are not going to give them any space to operate in the midfield.

Nigeria will lock horns with France at Roazhon Park in Rennes on Monday, June 17, starting from 2000 hours."
220,"Victor Moses has been about warm and fuzzy towards former teammate Eden Hazard after the latter completed his move to European powerhouse Real Madrid having inked a five-year deal that will keep him in the Spanish capital until June 2024.
Former Nigeria international Victor Moses was teammates with Hazard before joining Fenerbahce in the January transfer window.
While the Belgian arrived Stamford Bridge in June 2012 from Ligue 1 club Lille, Moses became a player of Chelsea two months later.
A day after Hazard's move to Real Madrid was confirmed, the Nigerian congratulated the Belgium star and labelled him a Chelsea legend.
During his time with The Blues, the 28-year-old winger played 352 games, scoring 110 goals, and won two Premier Leagues, two Europa Leagues, an FA Cup and a League Cup title.
Writing on Twitter, Moses said: ''Good luck to my brother @hazardeden10 🙌🏿 it was a pleasure playing with you and a true honour for me to be able to have called you my teammate 🙏🏿 you will always be a true Chelsea legend. Good luck bro 💙''.
Moses, now on loan at Fenerbahce, could end his spell with Chelsea in the summer transfer window having been linked with a permanent transfer to Inter Milan."
221,"Various reports say that manager Gernot Rohr is sweating over the fitness of several key players ahead of the Super Eagles Africa Cup of Nations opener against Burundi on Saturday, June 22.
Nigeria's preparations have suffered a blow with several players, including Ahmed Musa, Abdullahi Shehu, Henry Onyekuru, Leon Balogun and Paul Onuachu, hit by illness, while Oghenekaro Etebo and Chidozie Awaziem are not in tip-top condition having just recovered from the sickness bug that ravaged the squad.
The Super Eagles players and officials arrived in Alexandria on Monday evening after holding a one-week training camp in Ismailia and will be accommodated at the Helnan Palestine Hotel camp throughout the group phase.
The players worked out in the gym on Tuesday morning and will hold their first training session on grass this evening, starting from 1700 hours.
The training session will take place at Arab Academy for Science, Technlogy and Maritime Transport.
Nigeria will face Burundi, Guinea and Madagascar in Group B of the AFCON at the Alexandria Stadium, Alexandria."
222,"Super Eagles central defender William Troost Ekong has stated that he has no choice regarding who he partners at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. The Udinese star has often been paired with Brighton &amp; Hove player Leon Balogun but the latter had limited playing time for the English Premier League side in the 2018/2019 season with just eight league appearances. Conversely Leganes of Spain's Kenneth Omeruo who is loan from Chelsea was one of the mainstays at his club in the period under review and has been tipped to play alongside the Tottenham Hotspur product. ""What matters most is the interest of the team. It doesn't matter who starts on the field or comes off the bench,"" Ekong told the media. ""I have played with both Kenneth and Leon and they have different qualities so I can't say much about that subject. I have no favourite to pair with. The coach might even decide not to start me. ""Kenneth is an experienced player, he has won the Africa Cup of Nations. Leon is equally a good defender. The decision rests on the coach. We just want to win our matches,"" Troost whose breakthrough in the Eagles came after his excellent performances at the 2016 Olympics in Rio De Janeiro mused. Ekong made 35 Serie A appearances for the Zebras last season with 3,067 minutes of action to his credit."
223,"Turkish Super Lig side Fenerbahce are plotting to keep former Nigeria international Victor Moses at the club next season amid speculation linking him with a summer move to Inter Milan.
Moses joined the Yellow Canaries on a one-and-a-half-year loan deal in the January transfer window and it is thought that Chelsea can exercise a recall option on the player to end his loan spell before expiration.
It is claimed that Fenerbahce manager Ersun Yanal has held talks with Director of Football, Damien Comolli and a decision was made to retain Moses.
''Moses is a very high quality player. I believe he will be much more useful next season. What should be done to stay must be done,'' said Yanal, according to Turkish newspaper Hurriyet.
It was widely believed that Moses's career at Chelsea was over following the arrival of Maurizio Sarri in July 2018 but his situation could change, with the Italian linked with a return to his homeland as coach of Juventus and The Blues slapped with a two-window transfer ban for signing underage players."
224,"Super Eagles gaffer, Gernot Rohr, has admitted that Nigeria reaching the semifinal of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations will be difficult because of the quality of teams in the competition.
Nigeria are on a good run heading into the tournament, having remained undefeated since the end of the 2018 World Cup with five victories and three draws in eight competitive and friendly matches.
''For our fans, of course, it is clear that we will reach at least the semi-final. But that will be difficult because Egypt is a force at home,'' Rohr told Mannheimer Morgen.
''I hope we can play a good role. And certainly one or the other surprise team will emerge.
''The Africa Cup is something very special in terms of ambience and significance. Of course we want to do well.
""We must underestimate no opponent. Burundi, for example, eliminated Gabon in qualifying. It means being careful.''
Apart from Egypt, the likes of Senegal, Morocco and Tunisia are strong favorites to win the Africa Cup of Nations.
Three-time Africa champions, Nigeria will face Senegal in their final friendly on Sunday ahead of their AFCON opener against Burundi on June 22."
225,"Nigeria beat Burundi 1-0 courtesy of an Odion Ighalo's late goal in their first group game of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations at the Alexandria Stadium on Saturday evening.
Gernot Rohr's charges did really well to contain the plucky underdogs amidst a foray of missed chances and Daniel Akpeyi's saves to keep the three-time champions in it.
Samuel Chukwueze wowed the watching fans with some eye-catching solo runs but the Burundian defence remained resolute as the first period gradually fizzled out.
Ahmed Musa came on for Obi Mikel as the Super Eagles sought to break down their resilient opponents and the Al Nassr man was quick to join the flow, darting through the left to put in a really decent cross but the chance went begging.
The breakthrough eventually arrived after the introduction of Odion Ighalo, who ran onto the end of an Ola Aina lay-off to beat goalkeeper Njonathan, much to the ecstasy of the watching fans, handing Nigeria three points to build on."
226,"Aston Villa have been told they have to pay at least 25 million pounds to sign England U21 international of Nigerian descent, Tammy Abraham in the summer transfer window, if they are to stand an iota of chance to sign him.
Daily Mirror UK has reports that Tammy will be allowed by Chelsea to return to Villa Park, but not on another temporary deal &mdash; the Blues will push for a permanent transfer this time.
With 26 goals in all competitions, Abraham helped Aston Villa get promoted to the Premier League, yet, via the playoffs after beating Derby County 2-1 at Wembley.
Villa must improve their squad following promotion to the English top flight and the 21-year-old striker is a top target.
Although Chelsea are facing two transfer windows without being able to sign new players, French World Cup winner Olivier Giroud has been retained for next season and Gonzalo Higuain could be signed on a permanent deal from Juventus - which would push Abraham down the pecking order if he returns to The Blues.
The Camberwell-born striker has played only three games for Chelsea's first team."
227,"Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has confirmed that it was a tactical decision not to start Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers top scorer Ighalo in the 1-0 victory against Burundi on Saturday.
The former Watford star took his place among the substitutes before scoring the game-winner in the 77th minute, four minutes after coming off the bench to replace Paul Onuachu, who toiled fruitlessly.
''Burundi were in the same group with Mali and qualified, we saw the games, they were unbeaten in the qualifiers,'' Rohr said post-match after the game at the Alexandria Stadium.
''It is not easy especially as it was difficult to score the first goal. If the first goal does not come early, we suffer and have to work hard to win the match.
''Our plan was to bring in Ighalo when the other team perhaps give us more space and it happened today but we had a big problem physically.''
Rohr had been sweating over the fitness of several key players before today's fixture and got more bad news on Friday when Samuel Kalu collapsed in training and Abdullahi Shehu suffered an injury.
''So many players were sick in the last two weeks, there was a virus and half of the team had fever, was tired and could not train.
''Musa and Shehu could not complete the first half. Yesterday we lost two players in the training session.
''I am happy that the solidarity of the team made the difference.''
The Super Eagles face Guinea in the second Group B match on Wednesday, June 26 and a win would see them advance to the round of 16."

Meanwhile, Interior Minister, Ambrose Dery has assured that Ghana is on high alert for terrorist attacks.
&ldquo;It is increasingly clear that the greatest threat we have in this sub-region is terrorism although it has not even hit Ghana yet. Terrorism is, therefore, top security concern of the President of the Republic of Ghana and indeed all of us,&rdquo; he said.
Here is the full statement issued by government
&ldquo;National Security Officials held a meeting on Monday, June 10, 2019, at the Jubilee House, Accra.
The meeting was to examine recent travel advisories about Ghana and intelligence reports on Ghana&rsquo;s security situation.
The meeting concluded that there is no actionable intelligence nor an imminent threat to Ghana. Ghana&rsquo;s safety and risk profiles remain largely unchanged despite recent events in the sub-region.
The security apparatus of the nation continues to be retooled and vigilant to tackle any major security threat within the jurisdiction. Ghanaians, foreign residents and visitors are advised to continue to go about their normal ways of life without fear but also encouraged to be security conscious as always. Potential visitors are equally advised that just like other western jurisdictions, the isolated incidents of crime should not and indeed does not undermine the general safety and hospitality for which Ghana is so well known.&rdquo;

228,"Nigeria's U20 National Team have refused to vacate the Hotel Ambasador Premium in Lodz following their World Cup elimination at the hands of Senegal on Monday evening.
As the Flying Eagles players returned to their hotel last night, they started protesting the nonpayment of their entitlements since the start of preparations for the World Cup.
The Nigeria Football Federation have not paid the players their camp allowances and winning bonus for qualifying to the round of sixteen of the World Cup and the sum is around US$5,000 per player.
We recalled that the Flying Eagles officials gave the players dropped in Germany a parting gift of US$100.00 each which did not go down well with the players and one of the foreign based players rejected the money for being too meager.
Now, the Flying Eagles players are upset that the Nigerian Federation don't want to fulfill their obligations to the team and have claimed that the money has been released by the Federal Government.
The players have refused to shift their ground and have missed their flights to their respective destinations."
229,"Italian Serie A club are closing in on the signing of Nigeria international Victor Osimhen from Sporting Charleroi, according to reports.
La Derni&egrave;re Heure and Les Sports, Belgian newspapers, say Charleroi will lose one of their important players of last season as Osimhen is about to commit his future to Atalanta Bergamo.
The Nerazzurri have offered a fee of fifteen million euros which has been accepted by Sporting Charleroi.
Knowing that they stand to profit from the future sale of Osimhen, the Belgian First Division A side triggered the purchase option in his loan deal of around 3.5 million euros last week.
AC Milan and Lille had also been keen on the former Golden Eaglets sensation but Atalanta, who are featuring in next season's Champions League, moved in quickly to beat off competition.
Osimhen would become the most expensive signing in the history of Atalanta once the deal is completed.

230,"The flying eagles of Nigeria fell to a 2-0 defeat against the United States of America in their second Group D game of the 2019 U-20 World Cup at the Bielsko-Biała Stadium on Monday evening.
Paul Aigbogun, the coach of the Nigerian side, made just one change from the starting XI that trounced Qatar last time out, with Jerome Akor replacing Tijani Muhammad upfront.
The Yanks that showed the most initiative into the game and it paid off when Sebastian Soto headed home off an Alexis Mendez corner with barely eighteen minutes played.
And after skipper Ikouwem Utin saw his header saved by USA goalie Scott in the first period, Soto yet again punished a hesitant Nigerian backline just after the break to put his side 2-0 up.
Aigbogun's changes could do little to inspire his charges and in truth, the boys toiled through out the game and will now have to get a favourable result versus Ukraine in their last group game if they must progress to the next round."
231,"The Federal Government on Monday fulfilled years-long pledge to former Technical Adviser of the Super Eagles, Clemens Westerhof.
The was handed at a ceremony inside the conference room of the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, Abuja, the Honourable Minister, Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN) said the occasion was a further proof that the Buhari administration was &ldquo;committed to putting right the wrongs of yesterday and redressing all forms of yesterday&rsquo;s injustice&rdquo;.
Westerhof, a Dutchman, was head coach of the Super Eagles&rsquo; Class of 1994 &ndash; appropriately &ndash;styled Golden Generation &ndash; that won Nigeria&rsquo;s first &ndash;ever FIFA World Cup ticket, won Nigeria&rsquo;s first Africa Cup of Nations title on away ground and reached the Round of 16 at the FIFA World Cup in USA.
Fashola, himself a first-grade football enthusiast, eulogized the virtues of football as a &ldquo;great unifier, which does not bow to ethnic, religious or quota system considerations,&rdquo; and hailed Westerhof for his service in Nigeria&rsquo;s senior team with distinction, while apologizing on behalf of Nigeria that the pledge took 25 years to redeem.
&ldquo;Mr. Westerhof ended our long &ndash;time search for a FIFA World Cup ticket, and afterwards went on to lead the team to Africa Cup of Nations glory. As a nation, we made promises, but there was no follow-up,&rdquo; Fashola told nff. com.
&ldquo;I want the NFF to document those members of the squad that have not received their houses in the FCT as promised, and as soon as we receive this, we will respond positively.
I was made aware that the promises had not been fulfilled through a letter by the assistant coach, Mr. Johannes Bonfrere, and we arranged for him to get his own in December 2017.
&ldquo;Six months later, at the FIFA World Cup in Russia, a prominent journalist, Mr. Onochie Anibeze, brought it to my notice that the head coach, Mr. Westerhof was yet to receive his own house. We immediately initiated the process which has culminated in today&rsquo;s event.&rdquo;
Earlier, the Director of Public Building and Housing Development, Dickson Onoja had narrated the exploits of the Super Eagles&rsquo; Class of 1994, and how then military Head of State, Sani Abacha, hosted the team to a reception in Abuja after the AFCON triumph in Tunisia and promised each member of the team a house in Abuja.
Youth and Sports Minister, Barr. Solomon Dalung, who was represented by the Director of Federations and Elite Athletes Department, Mrs Tayo Oreweme, applauded the Ministry of Power, Works and Housing for fulfilling the pledge and referred to President Muhammadu Buhari&rsquo;s 2015 fulfilment of his pledge to the world -conquering Golden Eaglets of 1985 (when he was military Head of State).
The 2nd Vice President of NFF, Mallam Shehu Dikko, who represented NFF President Amaju Pinnick at the occasion, praised the initiative of Mr. Fashola and his ministry, saying the redemption of the pledge was a positive sign to footballers and other sportsmen and women that promises would always be fulfilled, no matter how long it took.
&ldquo;At the last NFF Football Awards in Lagos on 1st April, we honoured specially this Class of 1994 Super Eagles. Those of them that are still alive and in the country were brought to the event and celebrated. We will compile a list of those who have not received their houses and revert back to the Ministry.&rdquo;
Westerhof, who flew into Nigeria from The Netherlands for the event on Sunday night, said:
&ldquo;I am overjoyed. I want to thank the Nigerian Government for this, and I want to assure you that you will now see more of me in Nigeria.
&ldquo;Nigeria is my second fatherland, and I am proud of what we were able to achieve with the players in those years. They were disciplined, dedicated and determined to lift Nigeria high, and we took Nigeria from 79th position to 5th in the world. I am thankful. However, I feel sad that some of my players have left us. May their souls rest in peace.&rdquo;"
232,"The former Super Eagles&rsquo; winger has described Antonio Conte as the most important manager he has ever worked with, saying that the Italian football tactician left a mark on his career.
Prior to the arrival of the former Juventus and Italy boss at Chelsea, the right winger had spent three successive loan spells at Liverpool, Stoke City and West Ham United.
Conte revived the career of Moses by converting him into a wing back as they won the Premier League title for the 2016-2017 season and the FA Cup the following season.
''I have played under a lot of managers and I've loved every single one of them. The most important one was Antonio Conte. He just came in, he changed everything,'' Moses opened up to TRT World.
''He is an amazing man, he totally changed my game to be honest. He gave me that fighting spirit to believe in myself and to enjoy my football same time.
''And then when he came that first season, we won the league, the following season we won the FA Cup.
''It was an amazing season for me under Antonio Conte and I'll always respect him for that, he's an amazing man.''
The Chelsea-owned winger has been linked with a summer move to Inter Milan and was asked if he would be interested in reuniting with Conte, who is the favourite to replace Luciano Spalletti as coach of the Nerazzurri.
Moses said : ''To be honest I am here with Fenerbahce, I just want to keep on playing my football at the moment. I am happy with the club.
''As I said before I came here to play football and I'm playing the football at the moment and no one knows what the future is going to hold. I love the club.''"
233,"Chelsea have announced through their official website that the retired goalkeeper Petr Cech has been appointed as the club's Technical and Performance Advisor.
His job description entails providing advice on all football and performance matters throughout the club as well as facilitating strong links between the senior and academy teams, ensuring that the various support departments are working together effectively.
The veteran is also set to assume some of the responsibilities left by former Technical Director Michael Emenalo, who resigned from Chelsea in November 2017 before joining Monaco.
With Chelsea, Cech won 13 major titles including the Champions League and Europa League in 2012 and 2013 respectively."

The producer, who produced other soap operas like &lsquo;Supple Blues&rsquo;, was confirmed dead on March 12.
According to an online report, Emema&rsquo;s death was announced by one of his friends and colleague, Francis Onwochie in a message.
&ldquo;Yesterday, I received a call from Ada, his long-time business development officer.&ldquo;I called Mahmood Ali Balogun, our mutual friend and we both visited his house last night at Ago Palace Way Okota,&rdquo;Onwochie said."
234,"Charlton Athletic boss Lee Bowyer has confirmed that two unnamed Premier League clubs are interested in signing Nigerian midfielder Joe Aribo but face competition from Rangers in Scotland as well as French and German clubs.
Aribo has one week remaining on his contract with The Addicks and it is all but confirmed that he will move onto pastures new in the summer transfer window.
Arsenal, Manchester City and Southampton are reportedly monitoring the situation of the 22-year-old.
''There are Premier League clubs interested, I spoke to two yesterday,'' Bowyer told talkSPORT, according to the Scottish Sun.
''Obviously in Scotland you&rsquo;ve got Rangers that are interested and there are clubs in France and Germany.
''We&rsquo;ve got competition to fight against.
''Joe loves it at Charlton. But if Premier League clubs come in, financially and from the point of view of playing against the world&rsquo;s top players every week, it&rsquo;s tough for a kid to turn down.
''Everyone wants to play at the top. I&rsquo;ve been in the game so I understand.
''I&rsquo;d love to keep him but I think it&rsquo;s gonna be difficult.''
Aribo was signed by Charlton Athletic in 2015 and has scored 16 goals in 97 appearances for the club across all competitions."
235,"U20 coach of Nigeria, Paul Aigbogun, has accused the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) of thwarting the genuine players selection following Nigeria&rsquo;s exit from the 2019 FIFA U20 World Cup in Poland.
Aigbogun, who was the former gaffer of Enyimba and Warri Wolves, said he was betrayed by the NFF who he accused were involved in the scam of substandard players selection for the World Cup.
Aside from his claimed that the Nigerian Federation changed the list of players he originally selected for the World Cup, he also mentioned that the curator, team secretary and assistant coaches collected bribe 'on his behalf' to include players on the list.
The team secretary, Aliyu Ibrahim Lawal was forcing the Flying Eagles players to sign agency contracts, with the promise that they'll be featured during the tournament.
Meanwhile, Aigbogun's hands may not be clean as well, seeing as some stories have circulated about how he had no choice but to feature Peter Eletu in the Flying Eagles last two games in Poland after the midfielder's agent threatened to expose him for collecting bribe and not fielding the player.
He said he wanted to resign his appointment with the national team three times, in Poland and during the training camp in Germany, and accused the Plateau United coach of forcing him to take players to the World Cup.
Aigbogun claims he had to pay the team's video analyst and physical trainer, including their hotel bills, after the Nigerian Federation refused to pick up the tab."
236,"Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr, has confirmed that Bordeaux forward, Samuel Kalu and Chelsea defender, Ola Aina who played on loan at Torino last season are battling with fitness issues but should be alright in due time.
The German tactician fielded questions from curious reporters who watched the two players train separately from their teammates at the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba on Wednesday evening.
On Monday, Rohr had played down any fears of injury to Kalu, offering tartly:
 &ldquo;Kalu is okay, there is nothing wrong with him&rdquo;.
Kalu was part of the Super Eagles&rsquo; first training session at the Stephen Keshi Stadium on the same day (Monday) but the winger had his left thigh wrapped up in bandage.
The attacker has had to endure a series of injury setbacks in the past few months and one of such made him miss nothing less than two months of action for his French club Bordeaux during the 2018/19 season.
Despite his thigh being wrapped up in bandage, though, the skillful player showed no discomfort whatsoever all through the one hour and 45 minutes of the Super Eagles&rsquo; first training session.
However, Kalu and Aina have trained on their own in the last two sessions.
&ldquo;Yes, Ola Aina and Samuel Kalu have fitness problems right now, but it is nothing serious, though,&rdquo; Rohr said.
&ldquo;Our medical crew is attending to them and also giving them the necessary care they need for them to get back to a hundred per cent match fitness. However, we have to be careful with the two players, we need to be mindful of their physical and medical recovery.&rdquo;
The super Eagles will face the Warriors of Zimbabwe in an international friendly at the same Stephen Keshi Stadium at 6pm on Saturday, June 8 in preparation for the 2019/Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
The team will depart for Ismailia Egypt on a chartered flight on Sunday for their final training camp prior to the start of the AFCON 2019 where they will face Guinea, Burundi and Madagascar in Group B."
237,"Super Eagles defender, Leon Balogun, has promised he would offer the best he has ever had to, both on and off pitch, in the forthcoming AFCON tournament in Egypt.
The Super Eagles head into this month&rsquo;s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations looking to win a fourth continental title.
Having been winners the last time out &ndash; 2013 in South Africa, the Super Eagles despite the glut of talented individuals in the team, failed to qualify for the last two editions of the competition.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve qualified for this summer&rsquo;s African Cup of Nations, which is the most important thing because we failed to qualify for the previous two tournaments &ndash; having been winners in 2013,&rdquo; Balogun told Brighton &amp; Hove Albion official website.
&ldquo;There would have been an outrage if we hadn&rsquo;t qualified again; we are a nation of 200 million people and although we have our problems, football brings everyone together and so we have a responsibility beyond football.&rdquo;
Balogun joined Brighton last summer after running out his contract with German club FSV Mainz.
He however struggled for regular playing time with the Seagulls, making only eight Premier League appearances with a goal to his name.
The centre-back admits it was tough sitting on the sidelines for most of the season but assures he will work hard to earn starting roles in the team.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to lie, it&rsquo;s never easy, but as I said, you always have to be ready to play. All I can do is show my levels in training on a consistent basis, which I think I have done, and what that has done is also force those two to up their games as well &ndash; that&rsquo;s been my way of contributing to the team even when I&rsquo;m not playing,&rdquo; Balogun added.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s been a positive because for me, the team always comes first. It&rsquo;s not nice to be on the bench, but I&rsquo;m experienced enough to deal with that and there are other areas where you can help, maybe as a mentor to the younger players and to encourage the whole team in the dressing room. Whatever position I&rsquo;m in, whether I&rsquo;m on the pitch or on the bench, I always give it 100 per cent.&rdquo;

1462,"Ghana and Jamaica have both waived entry visa requirements for the citizens of either country wanting to travel to and from these two countries with effect from 1 July 2019.  This was disclosed at a joint press conference addressed by the President of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, and the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Andrew Holness, after the two held bilateral discussions in Kingston, Jamaica, on Saturday, 15 June 2019, as part of President Akufo-Addo&rsquo;s two-day official visit to jamaica.  Stressing the importance of Ghana-Jamaica relations, Mr Akufo-Addo indicated that the two nations have an excellent opportunity to build on their strong ties imposed by culture and history so as to derive maximum economic value for their respective populations.  &ldquo;We cannot have visas standing in the way of those relations, so, the decision has been taken by my government that as Ghanaians benefit from visa-free arrangements here in Jamaica, we are also going to provide visa-free arrangements for Jamaicans in Ghana to facilitate and also make it easier for you to come and join us for the &lsquo;Year of Return&rsquo;&rdquo;, President Akufo-Addo added.  With the two leaders pledging to reactivate the Ghana-Jamaica Permanent Joint Commission for Co-operation, which has been dormant for some time, the President explained that when properly structured, the Commission will serve as a legal framework for doing business between the two countries.  &ldquo;Now, it has come to the time to give teeth to those relations by making sure the various areas of engagement in education, tourism and cultural activity are specifically tied down. That is really my purpose of coming here, apart from a mission to sensitise you in Jamaica about an event that we are commemorating this year,&rdquo; he added.  Year of Return  Describing the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade as a &ldquo;horrendous episode of human history&rdquo;, President Akufo-Addo explained that Ghana is keen on commemorating this event, largely because a large number of slaves came through slave forts located in Ghana.  &ldquo;We want to commemorate it to be able to say together that never again will Africa and her people permit themselves to be subjugated to these types of dehumanising and inhumane events. Never again!&rdquo; he added.  The President continued: &ldquo;At the same time, we want to use the symbolism of this year to take concrete steps to solidify the relations of our kith and kin in the Americas and the Caribbean. The relationship that we are forming here in Jamaica will form part of the process of solidifying the relations between those of us on the continent of Africa and those of you in the diaspora, outside Africa.&rdquo;  His visit to the Caribbean, President Akufo-Addo said, has been to &ldquo;strengthen the relations across the water, and build the bridge that we have to build over the Atlantic so that we could find a way of strengthening each other in growing and empowering our economies, to play a more and more critical role in the new global architecture that is being drawn up now. We are going to have relations that are intimate.&rdquo;"
238,"Benfica defender Tyronne Ebuehi was unfortunate not to be included on the Super Eagles Africa Cup of Nations roster after failing to fully recover from a cruciate ligament injury he suffered in pre-season.
Two other World Cuppers in the shape of Eddy Onazi and Joel Obi have had their own injury problems but manager Gernot Rohr reckons that the former ADO Den Haag star would be missed the most.
Although the German has taken Ola Aina and Abdullahi Shehu, who are both classed as right fullbacks to Egypt, Ebuehi is a cut above the rest and that was epitomized by his performance against Iceland at the World Cup.
''The team is missing a good player, Tyronne Ebuhei, who has been injured for months,"" Rohr said in a press statement published by filgoal.com.
""The team has a young goalkeeper and two other goalkeepers with good experience and they played well during the last friendly against Senegal,"" he added.
Ebuehi played for the Super Eagles in all their friendlies before the 2018 World Cup, six in total, and became cap-tied to Nigeria when he made his competitive debut against Iceland on June 22, 2018."
239,"Francisca Ordega of Nigeria is confident the Super Falcons will get their FIFA Women's World Cup campaign back on track when they face South Korea at the Stade des Alpes, Grenoble on Wednesday afternoon.
At the World Cup, Nigeria have not managed a win in their last four matches, with their last victory coming against Canada in the 2011 edition.
Flamboyant on and off the pitch, Ordega was one of the few bright sparks as the Super Falcons suffered a 3-0 loss at the hands of Norway in their opener on Saturday.
''Our plan is to qualify for the next round. We don't want to go home so the next two games are very, very important,'' Ordega told fifa.com. ''We are going to fight. We are going to do everything we can to go through.""
Despite the heavens opening up, the Super Falcons still trained this morning ahead of tomorrow's game against the Asians who were thrashed 4-0 by France three days ago."

The new agreement between club and player keeps him at the Merkur Spiel-Arena until June 30, 2022.
Since 2011, the Germany youth international has been on the books of Fortuna D&uuml;sseldorf and has played 22 games for the first team.
He was farmed out on loan to VfL Osnabr&uuml;ck and Erzgebirge Aue in the last two seasons to continue his development.
In his first words after penning the new deal, Iyoha told Fortuna D&uuml;sseldorf's official website:
''I am very happy about my contract extension with the Fortuna.
''I grew up here and took my first steps as a professional at this club. That's why my extension has a special value for me''.
D&uuml;sseldorf-born Iyoha has represented Germany at U19, U20 and U21 levels."
241,"Coach Gernot Rohr has revealed that the return of Chelsea hero Obi Mikel was the reason behind his decision to drop Rotherham United's Semi Ajayi from the final roster that will defend the colours of Nigeria at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
The German football tactician stuck to his guns with regards to Leicester City's Kelechi Iheanacho, electing to omit the striker due to his poor goalscoring form for club and country.
''We had to do away with a defensive midfielder because Obi Mikel came back, he's well integrated in the group so we had to remove our player Semi Ajayi and also a striker who is lacking confidence but he worked very well,'' said Rohr to Super Eagles Media team.
''It was very difficult to decide but everybody, my staff, we are five people, we agreed about the two names. This decision was very objective, it's never a good decision to take but we had to do it.
''The two players had a very good professional attitude and accepted this decision, they know they are still on standby, there can be another injury and one of them will come.
''I hope nobody gets injured again but we had this case before the World Cup when we lost Moses Simon in the last camping and he had to be replaced.''
Ajayi and Iheanacho were surplus to requirements after they were not given a run-out in the Super Eagles goalless draw against Zimbabwe last Saturday in Asaba.

242,"Torino president, Urbano Cairo, has announced that a deal is well in place to land highly-rated Chelsea fullback, Ola Aina this summer, according to an Italian source.
Cairo has confirmed that Torino have taken advantage of a purchase option to sign the Super Eagles star on a permanent deal.
''We&rsquo;ve redeemed Aina for &euro;10m, as well as Cristian Ansaldi, and Koffi Djidji. Now Torino own all their players,'' Cairo told Football Italia.
Should the move go through, Aina will become the most expensive Nigerian fullback in history, breaking the record previously held by Celestine Babayaro, who was sold to Chelsea for &pound;2.25 million in 1997.
The former England U19 skipper had a good showing for Torino last season, playing 30 games as they finished seventh on the table.
Aina is set to represent Nigeria in his first major tournament after he was named in the Super Eagles final 23-man squad for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations."
1463,"Ghana&rsquo;s President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has received The Order of Excellence of Guyana, the highest national award of Guyana, at a State Luncheon held in his honour on Tuesday, 11th June, 2019, in Georgetown, Guyana.  Established in 1970 under the Constitution of the Orders of Guyana, the Order of Excellence of Guyana is limited to only 25 living citizens of Guyana.  Reading the citation after the conferment of the honour, the President of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, His Excellency David Arthur Granger, stated that his country was pleased to honour President Akufo-Addo &ldquo;for his dedication and commitment to the Commonwealth, the African Union, ECOWAS, and for his unflinching support for the rights of developing states.&rdquo;  Continuing, President Granger stated that &ldquo;President Akufo-Addo is recognised for his invaluable exertions in promoting economic security and stability on the continent of Africa, his steadfast dedication to regionalism, and tireless efforts to promote the interests of developing states.&rdquo;  Developing countries, the Guyanese President said, look to President Akufo-Addo&rsquo;s continued leadership and stewardship in the protection of their gains, and in securing their future.  &ldquo;I congratulate President Akufo-Addo on his investiture, and thank him for his stewardship in his own country, and his leadership in the developing world, and, particularly, in the interests of the small nations of Africa, Asia and the Caribbean,&rdquo; he added.  Prior to holding bilateral discussions with his Guyanese counterpart, President Akufo-Addo laid a wreath at the 1763 Monument.  The 1763 Monument structure was built to commemorate the 1763 rebellion, also known as the &ldquo;Great Rebellion&rdquo;, that occurred on plantation Magdelenenburg in Berbice, Region 6. The plantation was located on the Upper Canje River, and was owned by one Madam Vernesobre.  On February 23, 1763, the uprising, that is considered the first true attempt by slaves to fight for their freedom in an organised fashion, started.  During the revolt, a household slave named &lsquo;Cuffy&rsquo;, also spelt &lsquo;Kofi&rsquo;, from plantation Lilienburg, quickly assumed a leading role in the rebellion, and organised a number of riots against plantations owners. The uprising lasted for more than a year before the Dutch were able to overcome the slaves.  Today, &lsquo;Cuffy&rsquo; is a national hero in Guyana. The anniversary of the Cuffy slave rebellion, 23 February, has been Republic Day in Guyana since 1970.

243,"FC Augsburg have announced the signing of former Super Eagles invitee Noah Sarenren Bazee after he completed a successful medical, according to a report.
The talented winger -who last played for Hannover 96- has put pen to paper on a five-year contract with his new employer, until June 30, 2024.
''I want to take the next step in my development in Augsburg and I&rsquo;m happy that the FCA board have put their trust in me,&rdquo; Bazee told the club&rsquo;s official website.
''I&rsquo;m looking forward to playing my first games in an Augsburg shirt.''
Bazee was born in Stadthagen to a German mother and a Nigerian father. He, one time, trained with the Super Eagles in March 2017 but could not make his debut in a friendly against Senegal because he was struggling with a knee injury.
He has been allocated the number 17 jersey for the 2019-2020 campaign.
Prior to his transfer to Augsburg, the 22-year-old recorded 15 appearances in the German top flight during his six-year stint at Hannover 96."
244,"Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr is still undecided over his first choice goalkeeper at the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
Deportivo de La Coru&ntilde;a's Francis Uzoho has fallen out of favour with the German due to his inactivity in the second half of last season while there is uncertainty over the fitness of Ikechukwu Ezenwa.
The oldest player in the squad, Daniel Akpeyi was brought into the starting line-up against Zimbabwe last weekend, a sure sign that there has been a reversal of fortunes as the Kaizer Chiefs star was clearly the number three ranked goalkeeper in the pecking order at the 2018 World Cup.
''We don't know yet who is the number one goalkeeper, we will decide after the preparations but there are three good goalkeepers and we trust them,'' Rohr told the Super Eagles Media team.
''Our strength is the solidarity because if there is somebody with problems, the other one will help him on and off the pitch.''
With the exception of Moses Simon who was ruled out of the World Cup due to injury, seven new faces have been named on the Super Eagles AFCON roster after impressing for their respective clubs last season.
Chelsea icon John Obi Mikel has decided to return to the squad after a self-imposed sabbatical that lasted for one year.
''We have eight new players coming in, bringing fresh mentality inside the group so it is good refreshing atmosphere which can help us in Egypt.
''The experience of Obi Mikel - everybody wanted him to come back. He has been well received by the group as if he has always been with us.
''The reintegration of Obi Mikel has been done very well and he showed against Zimbabwe that he's on the right way to be very fit,'' Rohr concluded.
"
245,"Deputy captain Ahmed Musa is hopeful that none of the 23 players named to the team's Africa Cup of Nations squad will suffer injury setbacks.
The Al Nassr of Saudi Arabia forward believes it is time to focus on the team's fitness rather than the form of the players prior to the Nations Cup.
""Its flattering to be appreciated for what you have done with your club before a major tournament like this (AFCON),"" Musa, who won the Saudi Professional Football League title told sources.
""Now we are going for the Nations Cup and our prayer and expectations should be to be injury free.
""The players have worked hard to qualify the team for the Nations Cup so we hope that no one suffers any injury,"" Musa, who was in the Eagles side that won the AFCON in 2013 stressed.
Musa scored seven league goals in 24 appearances in the 2018/2019 season for his club.
The Super Eagles will on Sunday in Ismailia, Egypt, face Africa's best ranked team by FIFA, Senegal, in their last preparatory friendly game ahead of the 2019 AFCON before traveling to Alexandria where they will play their Group B matches of the AFCON.

246,"Forward, Moses Simon, has said he is delighted to make Nigeria&rsquo;s 23-man squad for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, and is ready to play an unnatural role as left-back if Gernot Rohr so desires.
The player, who missed the 2018 FIFA World Cup finals in Russia on account of injury, was drafted to defensive role by Super Eagles manager, Gernot Rohr, as the squad strategized in Asaba.
The proposed formation gives the team more attacking options even as Rohr has been stressing that the Levante forward is a versatile player.
&ldquo;I can say it (left back) is not my position, but I&rsquo;ve no option than to play there and serve my fatherland,&rdquo; Moses responded.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll do my best to make my people proud and happy.&rdquo;
There was apprehension amongst the players at their Golden Tulip training camp, Asaba, Delta State, before the final 23-man list was called.
&ldquo;What was going through my mind when the list was yet to be called was that I don&rsquo;t want to miss the Nations Cup after I missed the World Cup in Russia,&rdquo; Simon told the media.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve really worked hard for a place in the team but the decision was for the coach to make if he would take me or not.
&ldquo;I must say it was not easy to make the 23-man list. So I&rsquo;m delighted to be there.
&ldquo;We are all fighting for a place in the team. And it is not over yet, I must say, because everyone is good to make a good AFCON team.
&ldquo;So now, the next level is to fight for a position in the starting line up. And I believe the coach has the best decision to make, to put the right players in the right positions because we need good result in Egypt.&rdquo;"
247,"The Super Falcons have landed in Grenoble, where they will take on former champions Germany in a round of 16 tie of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup on Saturday.
The fitness update ahead of the meeting at the Stade des Alpes has revealed that of Barcelona striker Asisat Oshoala is 'definitely fit' to start against the Germans.
The former Arsenal and Liverpool striker had to play through the pain barrier in the final group match vs France before she was substituted in the 85th minute.
On Wednesday, Oshoala had a gym session with the rest of her teammates but was excused from the training session on grass, but the following day she participated in full training.
With Ngozi Ebere (red carded) and Rita Chikwelu (accumulated bookings) suspended for tomorrow's game, manager Thomas Dennerby will be forced to make at least two changes to the starting line-up.
Evelyn Nwabuoku could replace Ohale Osinachi in central defence while the Vaxjo DFF star could take up the left-back role."
1464,"Ghana came third after Botswana and Malawi respectively in the most peaceful country in Africa in the latest Global Peace Index.
Ghana placed 44th in the world with Iceland leading the overall chartas the most &lsquo;peaceful&rsquo; nation on Earth in the 2019 Global Peace Index.

In addition, the world&rsquo;s overall &lsquo;peacefulness&rsquo; has improved for the first time in five years &ndash; although only marginally.
Afghanistanwas bottom of the list, moving below evenSyria, while South Sudan, Yemen andIraqwere all in the bottom five.
The report measures the &lsquo;peacefulness&rsquo; of 163 countries with a range of measures including military spending and deaths from conflict and terrorism, as well as an estimated economic cost of violence.
Iceland, often portrayed as an idyllic Nordic paradise, came first in the rankings for the 12th year in a row as researchers praised the country&rsquo;s falling murder rate and increase in funding to UN peacekeeping.
&lsquo;The strong institutions, attitudes and structures of peace that Iceland maintains has bolstered the country&rsquo;s resilience against small internal shocks,&rsquo; they said.
New Zealand came second, as the report&rsquo;s authors noted the violence of the Christchurch mosque attack but said the country had improved other scores and developed a &lsquo;resilience&rsquo; to cope with such disasters.
Portugal was third, and Austria fourth despite an increase in &lsquo;likelihood of violent demonstrations&rsquo; after a far-right party joined the government.
Denmark was fifth, with European nations dominating the top of the list.
&lsquo;Europe remains the most peaceful region in the world and it recorded a very slight improvement in peacefulness after several years of deterioration,&rsquo; the report said.
&lsquo;However, despite these improvements, the broader political environment in Europe remains uncertain, and resurgent nationalism and terrorism remain significant threats to peace.&rsquo;
Brexit was also mentioned, as researchers said the UK &lsquo;continues to struggle with its plan for exiting the European Union&rsquo; in what they called a &lsquo;mixed&rsquo; year for international relations.
Japan scored highly among leading world powers, coming in as the world&rsquo;s 9th-most peaceful country.
Germany was 22nd, the United Kingdom 45th and France 60th, while the United States dropped four places to 128th.
The report&rsquo;s authors cited &lsquo;growing political polarisation&rsquo; in America, adding that tensions had grown between Washington and Iran.
&lsquo;Confidence in US leadership has fallen the most in the past five years, with people now having more confidence in China than the US on average,&rsquo; they noted.
Australia&rsquo;s score also fell slightly, as researchers said the country had increased its military expenditure and weapons imports.
Russia scored badly, coming 10th from bottom, below North Korea.
Afghanistan was bottom, scoring even worse than Syria, where ISIS was swept out of its last patch of territory earlier this year.
&lsquo;Despite the improvement this year, the world remains considerably less peaceful now than a decade ago,&rsquo; the report&rsquo;s authors said.
&lsquo;A wide range of factors drove the fall in peacefulness over the past decade including increased terrorist activity, the intensification of conflicts in the Middle East, rising regional tensions in Eastern Europe and northeast Asia, increasing numbers of refugees, and heightened political tensions in Europe and the U.S.,&rsquo; they explained.
The slight uptick in peacefulness this year was partly fuelled by a reduction in military spending, the report found.
Seventy-two of the countries studied had reduced their level of military expenditure as a share of GDP.
There were also particular regional improvements, including in North Macedonia which struck an agreement with Greece to settle the long-running name dispute between the countries.
There was also an easing of the conflict in Ukraine, where fewer lives were lost.
Not all countries were included in the rankings, with small European nations such as Luxembourg and Liechtenstein among those left out.

248,"Nigeria women national team advanced their preparation for the 2019 FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup in France as they come from a goal down to beat Hungarian women&rsquo;s first division club, Haladas Viktoria 5-1 in a pre-tournament friendly on Tuesday.
Asisat Oshoala grabbed a couple while other strikes from Chinwendo Ihezuo, Francisca Ordega, and Ogonna Chukwudi sealed a comfortable win for the Super Falcons.
Haladas Viktoria took an early lead in the seventh minute but Chinwendo Ihezuo restored parity in the 32nd minute finishing off a fine assist from Ordega.
At the start of the second half, Ordega&rsquo;s powerful header three minutes after the hour mark from Ngozi Okobi&rsquo;s cornerkick put the Super Falcons of Nigeria 2-1 ahead.
With 20 minutes left to play, coach Thomas Dennerby subbed off the starting line-up, replacing them with Asisat Oshoala, Amarachi Okoronkwo, Chidinma Okeke, Alice Ogebe, Anam Imo, Chinaza Uchendu, Ngozi Ebere, Evelyn Nwabuoku, Ogonna Chukwudi and Uchenna Kanu.
The change made an instant impact with Oshoala hitting a double in space of two minutes. Both goals were assisted by Chinaza Uchendu.
Kanu came close to making it 5-1 but her header went inches wide in the 80th minute.Ogonna Chukwudi sealed the emphatic win scoring the fifth goal for the Super Falcons off a pass from Anam Imo.
The Super Falcons will play another friendly before they depart Austria where they are on two-week residential camping.
The Nigerian team will leave for France on Tuesday, 4th June. They will play Norway, Korea Republic and host nation France, in that order, in the group phase of the 2019 FIFA Women&rsquo;s World Cup."
249,"Fikayo Tomori has distanced himself from speculation linking him with a return to parent club Chelsea in the summer, having spent the entirety of the 2018-2019 campaign on loan at Derby County.
With Chelsea slapped with a two-window transfer ban as a result of malpractice with regards to signing underage players, there has been talk that the central defender may be handed first team opportunities next season.
England U21 star of Nigerian descent was a key player for Derby County in the recently concluded season, helping them reach the final of the Championship play-off and winning the Player of the Year award.
Asked if he would think about a second stint at Derby County, Tomori told BBC East Midlands Sport: ''Of course. I have loved it. I grew so much as a player. Derby is such a great club.
''The manager has shown me a lot of confidence playing me in a lot of games. I have nothing but good words to say about Derby, the club, the fans and my team-mates.
""I am really proud. We are disappointed and we are hurting, but we had such a fantastic season. Even though we lost, we still had a lot of good moments to look back on and cherish.
""I am not really thinking about Chelsea at the moment but we will see when the new season comes''.
Tomori is the second most-used player by Frank Lampard , making 47 appearances (46 as a starter) in the Championship."
250,"Villarreal and Nigeria international Samuel Chukwueze has been crowned the best dribbler for the 2018/2019 La Liga season, according to a statistics guru.
Whoscored recorded the Nigeria international completed more dribbles (52) than any other player aged 21 and under in LaLiga this season.
Chukwueze had an excellent campaign for Villarreal, helping the Yellow Submarine avoid relegation and the highlight of his performance was netting and providing an assist in the 4-4 thriller with Barcelona back in April.
The 20-year-old contributed 7 goals (5 goals, 2 assists) from 26 appearances over the course of the season.
Sticking to the headline, Chukwueze averaged two dribbles per game, 0.6 less than his average dribbles in the Europa League.
Last week, he was named among the top twelve best young talents in LaLiga Santander for the 2018-2019 season."
251,"Burundi forward Saido Berahino has sent words across to Nigeria players ahead of tomorrow's Africa Cup of Nations Group B clash between Nigeria and Burundi.
Stoke City front man is confident that the Swallows are capable of causing an upset when they face the Super Eagles because not much is known about the team.
''We are lucky to qualify and we have to take advantage of the opportunity, and our chance that many do not know anything about us, which may help us to win,"" Berahino told reporters at Friday's pre-match press conference.
""It is a great honor for my entire country, the people of Burundi were very happy and we have to be happy again.''
He added : ""The Nigerian players are convinced that they will win as a strong team, but we will not let them do that, we will do our best to win tomorrow.
""The most beautiful thing about football is that it is full of surprises, which is what we are trying to exploit and we will take things step by step.''
Burundi are the least placed team in the FIFA rankings in Group B, sitting at position 134.
An appearance in the tournament will be their first ever after decades of trying and not being successful."
252,"England legend Gary Lineker was full of praise for Alex Iwobi after seeing the beauty of his consolation goals in Arsenal's 4-1 loss to Chelsea in the final of the Europa League on Wednesday night.
The Nigeria international was one of the few bright sparks as the Gunners threw away another chance to qualify for the Champions League, and several fans questioned the decision to name him on the bench, especially as German playmaker Mesut Ozil struggled during the game.
Iwobi's goal was a real collector's item, scoring with a right-footed rocket from outside the area after Chelsea failed to clear their lines in the 69th minute.
Via social media, Lineker, the 1986 World Cup Golden Boot winner, said :
''That is one hell of a goal from Iwobi. We&rsquo;ve seen some bonkers games in Europe this season. Not again, surely.''
It was a historic goal as Iwobi became the first Nigerian player to score in the final of a European club competition, a feat the likes of Nwankwo Kanu, Finidi George, Taribo West, Chidi Odiah, Dickson Etuhu, Jonathan Akpoborie, Yakubu Aiyegbeni and Stephen Keshi failed to accomplish.
Iwobi is the first substitute to score in a Europa League final since J&ocirc;natas for Espanyol in 2007.
"
254,"Valentine Ozorwafor has joined Jamil Muhammad in the treatment room and will not be available for selection when the Flying Eagles take on Ukraine at the Stadion Miejski (Bielsko-Biała) on Thursday evening.
The central defender, who currently pays for Enyimba, suffered an injury in the second Group D match against the United States and the latest update from Poland is that he failed a fitness test on Wednesday.
Ozornwafor has been diagnosed with a groin injury and the Nigeria Football Federation are yet to put a timescale on his return unlike Jamil Muhammad who has been ruled out for the remainder of the FIFA U20 World Cup.
Manager Paul Aigbogun has sixteen outfield players he can call upon for the crucial game against the Ukrainians.
Rosenborg starlet Igoh Ogbu is in line to replace Ozornwafor in central defense in what would be his debut at the FIFA U20 World Cup.
Nigeria sit second on the Group D table with three points from two matches and must avoid defeat on Thursday evening to stand a chance of progressing to the knockout rounds."
255,"Chelsea have announced that defender Ola Aina has joined Serie A side, Torino on a permanent deal.
The left-back spent last season on loan at Torino and made a huge impression at the club prompting the Italian club to trigger a buyout option in their loan agreement.
&ldquo;Everyone at Chelsea Football Club would like to thank Ola for his services and we wish him the best of luck for the next stage in his career,&rdquo; a statement on Chelsea&rsquo;s official website read in part.
Torino also posted a short message on their Social Media platforms expressing their delight on the permanent acquisition of Aina from Chelsea.
The 22-year-old defender made 30 league appearances as Torino finished seventh, scoring his first goal for the club in a 1-0 win over Udinese in February.
An FA Youth Cup and UEFA Youth League winner during his time at the Chelsea academy, Aina made just three Premier League appearances for the London side, all of which came in his second season as a senior professional as Antonio Conte guided them to the Premier League title.
Aina&rsquo;s departure means Cesar Azpilicueta and David Zappacosta are the only right-backs in the Chelsea squad.
The versatile defender is in Nigeria&rsquo;s squad for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
"
256,"Liverpool midfielder Naby Keita has revealed that Guinea have to change their approach for their second Group B match against Nigeria on Wednesday, June 26.
The Syli Stars were almost beaten in their opener against Madagascar but earned a share of the spoils in a 2-2 draw after Bordeaux striker Francois Kamano converted a spot kick in the 66th minute.
Keita was introduced off the bench in the 62nd minute, his first competitive game since suffering an injury against Barcelona in the semifinal of the Champions League on May 1.
Guinea's defensive frailties were exposed by Madagascar and the Liverpool star has insisted that they must avoid making mistakes at the back in their next game vs Nigeria.
Speaking to reporters in the mixed zone after yesterday's game, Keita said:
 ''I think we have to play forward and we have to try to play with aggression.
''When you score, do not accept that the opposing team equalizes because in this kind of tournament, do not give the opportunity to the opponent when you lead.''
Nigeria will qualify for the round of 16 of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations if they beat Guinea on Wednesday."
257,"Striker Tammy Abraham has confirmed he will not move from Chelsea just yet amid speculation linking him with a departure from Stamford Bridge before the close of the summer transfer window.
Club legend Frank Lampard is the overwhelming favorite to take the reins at The Blues after Maurizio Sarri left the club after one season in charge.
And Abraham has spoken of his desire to develop further under the England and Chelsea legend who led Derby County to the promotion playoff final last season.
FIFA have hit Chelsea with a two-window transfer ban, meaning that they can't sign players until the summer of 2020.
''These two windows are a great opportunity for the young players at Chelsea to show what they can do. That&rsquo;s how all the young players at the club are looking at it,'' Abraham told The Sun UK.
''Whoever goes into Chelsea as manager I am going to show him what I am truly made of.&rdquo;''Chelsea have always had a great academy but they have lacked playing them and taking them to the next level.
''Fingers crossed, if it all goes well it changes the mind-set at the club. Of course, the transfer ban is probably not what the club wanted but for us it is exciting.
''This year is the most important year for us youngsters at Chelsea &mdash; it is now or never.''Including his appearance in last season's Community Shield, Abraham has played three matches for Chelsea's first team."

Furthermore, US West Texas intermediate crude futures were down 28 cents,0.5 percent, at 51.65 dollars. They dropped by 1.1 percent on Monday.
According to the New York Federal Reserve, the gauge of business growth in New York state posted a record fall this month to the lowest level in more than 2 to 1/2 years, giving an abrupt contraction in regional activity.
US business sentiment had created tensions between China and the United States.
Oil prices have fallen around 20 percent since 2019 highs reached in April, in part, due to concerns about the US - China trade war and disappointing economic data."
258,"Guinea coach Paul Put is aiming to get their campaign back on track against one of the strongest teams in the competition, three-time Africa champions Nigeria.
Guinea must avoid defeat in their next Africa Cup of Nations match against Nigeria in order to brighten their chances of advancing to the last 16 of the competition.
The Syli Stars were almost beaten in their opener against Madagascar but earned a share of the spoils in a 2-2 draw after Bordeaux striker Francois Kamano converted a spot kick in the 66th minute.
''I know I have a big game to play on Wednesday against Nigeria. Today the group that did not start the match against Madagascar trained and the other group worked in the massage room,'' Put told guineefoot.info after training on Sunday.
''Nigeria is a great team, and it's up to us to be bigger.''
The Super Eagles have faced Guinea 17 times in the past, winning five, drawing seven and losing five."
259,"The Super Eagle player representative boycotted the mandatory pre-match press conference held at the Alexandria Stadium on Tuesday morning ahead of their second group match at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations against Guinea.
The Super Eagles players were having an in-house meeting as the press conference was ongoing.
A verifiable source has confirmed to news men that the reason why the players are having a meeting and one player did not show up at the press conference is because funds supposed to be credited to their accounts on Monday is being delayed by the Nigerian Federation.
It has been suggested that the money has been approved but the players have not received the payments due to bank issues.
The players are angry and disappointed with the Federation, and that's why a nominated player refused to come for the press conference.
The three-time African champions are scheduled to train at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology &amp; Maritime Transport on Tuesday afternoon, starting from 1630 hours.
"
260,"The coach of the Nigerian Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has expressed his joy upon the fact that Bordeaux winger Samuel Kalu has recovered in time for a starting berth against Guinea on Wednesday, but still worried something players need more time to be ready for game time.
The German football tactician was delighted that Bordeaux winger Samuel Kalu has been cleared by the medical team to participate in the tournament after collapsing in training last Friday and confirmed that he was sweating over the fitness of his two fullbacks.
''My problem at the moment is the recovery of the injured players Collins and Shehu two fullbacks, and this is my tactical problem for the moment.
''We had this physical problem, some players had fever but it is getting better now which is good news.
''The very good news is that Kalu did yesterday again in Cairo a MRI and it is now 100 percent sure that he is fit and he will be available for the game, and he already started training with the team, so we are happy about it because everybody was a little bit scared when this happened.
''I want to thank the CAF organization because immediately the ambulance was here and took him to hospital. They did a great job,'' Rohr added.
Nigeria beat Burundi 1-0 in their AFCON opener on Saturday thanks to Odion Ighalo's 77th minute strike after coming off the bench."
261,"Abdullahi Shehu is doubtful to suit up for Nigeria when they take on Guinea in their second group match at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations.
The Super Eagles first-choice right-back aggravated a pre-existing injury in the 1-0 win vs Burundi which led to his substitution in the 42nd minute of the contest at the Alexandria Stadium.
The initial prognosis from the Super Eagles medical team is that he would not recover in time to face the Syli Stars.
Coach Gernot Rohr is also sweating over the fitness of left-back Jamilu Collins and Bordeaux winger Samuel Kalu.
The Super Eagles trained today but the Nigerian Federation barred the media and fans from watching proceedings.
On Tuesday afternoon starting from 1630 hours, they will hold their last workout pre-Guinea and it is open for only fifteen minutes, while the mandatory pre-match press conference is at 1100 hours."
262,"Nigeria's Super Eagles defeated the Syli National of Guinea 1-0 in their second Group B game of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations at the Alexandria Stadium and thus booked their place in the Round of 16 stages after two wins.
Chelsea-owned defender Kenneth Omeruo grabbed Nigeria's vital winner in the second half after a hard fought first 45 minutes.
The win was the sixth for the Eagles against Guinea in 18 meetings albeit they had not won in four previous games against them.
Guinea's Ibrahima Cisse had the first chance of the game in the second minute when he rifled in a shot that Daniel Akpeyi in goal for Nigeria was unable to save the first time of asking with his defence clearing the ball.
Arsenal forward Alex Iwobi dallied on the ball in Guinea's six yard box just four minutes into the game when Moses Simon delivered an exquisite pass unto his path.
Goal scoring chances came the way of the Eagles even more in the first half but Odion Ighalo was guilty of wasting two opportunities - one which he could have scored himself and an angled shot in the 32nd minute that went agonizingly wide when Ahmed Musa was well placed to prod home.
Ahmed Musa embarked on a mazy run in the 58th minute but his end product was disappointing as he sought to find Ighalo.
The ball was cleared by the eagle eyed Guinean defence. He was booked afterwards for tracking back and fouling Fran&ccedil;ois Kamano.
Two minutes later Alex Iwobi's rasping shot was parried away for corner by Ibrahim Kone in the opposition goal.
The Guinean keeper also kept out Oghenekaro Etebo's free-kick a minute later.
Omeruo broke the deadlock in the 73rd minute as he scored with a glancing header from a Moses Simon's corner kick.
Samuel Chukwueze was introduced in place of Alex Iwobi with fourteen minutes left on the clock.
The game ended in a one goal thriller as Syli national were unable to answer a reply."
263,"Enyimba of Aba first choice goalkeeper, Theophilus Afelokhai, says there is no goalkeeping issues in the Super Eagles, not even in the ongoing 32nd Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
Afelokhai, a former Kano Pillars captain, says all the three goalkeepers Gernot Rohr took to Egypt are all good enough for the job, stressing that Nigerian football is not in short supply of quality goalkeepers.
The hugely decorated shot-stopper spoke against the back drop of criticism, fears and worries by Nigerians who suggest the goalkeeping department of the senior national team remains the weakest point of the squad.
&ldquo;Nigeria is blessed with lots of good goalkeepers,&rdquo; the soft-spoken goalie told Completesports.com in an exclusive interview.&ldquo;And at any point in time, the bests are picked to represent the country even at the ongoing Nations Cup in Egypt.
&ldquo;I believe we don&rsquo;t have any reason to worry about the qualities of the goalkeepers coach Rohr took to Egypt.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t also believe there is any need to say the Super Eagles goalkeeping department is weak, no.
&ldquo;Individually, they are fantastic goalkeepers, as a team, they are doing well and we should support them with prayers.&rdquo;
Many, especially those who follow his career in the domestic top flight, NPFL believe he&rsquo;s ripe enough to be the Super Eagles&rsquo; number one. But Afelokhai reasons differently, saying God&rsquo;s time is the best.
&ldquo;When it pleases God for me to make it in the Super Eagles, He will make it happen,&rdquo; he told the media.
&ldquo;One has to wait for God&rsquo;s appointed time. There is time for everything and for everybody. Those who are in the team right now are worthy of it, so we must support them through prayers.&rdquo;
The Super Eagles completed a 1-0 victory over Guinea in their second Group B match, and have now qualified for the knockout stage of the African Cup of Nations in Egypt.
"
264,"Super Eagles defender -Kenneth Omeruo- was delighted that Nigeria has advanced to the last 16 of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations thanks to his game-winning goal in the 73rd minute of the contest.
Omeruo, who was named Man of the Match by CAF, has stressed that the Super Eagles were focused on the pitch despite the fact they were involved in a pay dispute with the Nigerian Federation 24 hours before their second Group B match, leading to Ahmed Musa boycotting the mandatory pre-match press conference.
''We knew no matter what is going on off the pitch, our job is to play,'' Omeruo told reporters in the mixed zone shortly after the game against the Syli Stars.
''Nigerians are hoping that we win every game, so we knew we had to forget everything and focus on today's game and be the first to qualify from our group, I am happy we could achieve that.''
Rohr&rsquo;s Super Eagles completed yet another cleansheet as they prevented the opponents from scoring for the second straight game, and Omeruo has praised his defensive colleagues.
''For me it is important to say focused, we have a wonderful squad. I have been out for a while and they have been playing and being doing good.
''It doesn't matter who plays, we have a strong defence and it showed today. I just want to give my best,'' added Omeruo.
Omeruo did not find the net in more than 40 appearances for the Super Eagles before opening his goalscoring account against the Syli Stars."
265,"Stoke City-Nigeria star Oghenekaro Etebo has revealed Mikel&rsquo;s impeccable role that motivates the players whether or not he's on the pitch.
Of the line-up that started Nigeria's 1-0 win against Burundi last Saturday, coach Gernot Rohr dropped five players for yesterday's second Group B match against Guinea, including his influential skipper John Obi Mikel.
The Chelsea legend who is participating in his fifth AFCON was dropped in favor of Alex Iwobi in the playmaking position.
''I must tell you he is a good leader, quality leader for that matter even when he is not on the pitch, he always encourages everyone,'' Etebo said to reporters in the mixed zone.
''He usually use to say we should stay as a nation which is very important and I respect him because it shows he is a leader on and off the pitch.
''The most important thing is that every team that wants to succeed sticks together because that's what the manager use to say, whoever is playing or not.''
'He usually use to say we should stay as a nation which is very important and I respect him because it shows he is a leader on and off the pitch.
The Super Eagles have been brilliant in defence so far at the AFCON, posting two shutouts in back-to-back matches, but have struggled to break down the opposition having scored only two goals.
''The most important is that we get the three points, you saw the game between Ghana and Benin, they had a a 2-2 draw. Even if you score one goal and you have three points, it is very important and it's vital.
''That doesn't count if you score three, four or five goals, the most important is to get a win and three points,'' added Etebo.
On the Super Eagles advancing to the last 16 with a game to spare, the Nigeria number 8 said : ''I am excited about it, not only just me but the nation is excited about it.''"
266,"Brighton &amp; Hove defender Leon Balogun has talked about the performance of Liverpool midfielder Naby Keita in the Super Eagles' 1-0 win against the Guineans on Wednesday, June 26.
The Liverpool star was praised for his efforts in what was his second competitive game since he suffered an injury against Barcelona in the semifinal of the Champions League last month.
With uncertainty over the fitness of William Troost-Ekong, Balogun was handed his Africa Cup of Nations debut by manager Gernot Rohr and he put in an excellent shift at center back.
''It was not only me that came into the team, but also other positions,'' Balogun told reporters in the mixed zone.
''I think we have done a great job, defending them away, they were very, very dangerous on counter-attacks especially when Naby Keita has got the ball, he always sees something, he knows how to create chances. Even if he has to protect the ball he does a very great job.
''At the end we were better, that's why we qualified.''
Regarding Sunday's match against Madagascar, Balogun added : ''We have another game against Madagascar, I would say it's a wrong approach to take the game easy because there's another game coming after and we would be well advised to keep our form up.
''Madagascar won't take it easy, they also want to qualify, they've still got chances after their draw against Guinea in the first game, so it won't an easy one but definitely we can be more relaxed than them''.
The Super Eagles have six points from their first two matches at the AFCON and became the first team to advance to the round of 16."
287,"Russian Premier League giants CSKA Moscow are looking to pull off an audacious move for Henry Onyekuru.
According to the Mirror, the Muscovites have contacted Everton to declare their interest in signing the Super Eagles winger.
Onyekuru joined Everton in the summer of 2017 from Belgian side KAS Eupen but he has yet to make his competitive debut for the Toffees because he has not been granted a work permit.
The 22-year-old was first loaned to Anderlecht before he was shipped out on another loan for the 2018-2019 season.
He scored 16 goals in 44 appearances at Galatasaray last term, helping the Istanbul club win the Super Lig and the Cup.
The Turkish champions are interested in signing Onyekuru but face competition from clubs in France, Spain, Germany and Russia."
267,"A Nigerian midfielder Joe Aribo has confirmed that Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard convinced him to join Scottish Premiership giants Rangers ahead of other teams interested in his signature.
The former Charlton Athletic star had been linked with possible moves to Arsenal, Manchester City, Aston Villa, Brentford, Stoke City, Celtic, Benfica among others, and he has revealed that he chose Rangers because of the size of the club.
Speaking to Rangers TV after penning a four-year deal, Aribo said:
''[I chose here] because of the size of the club of course, but also the manager. I had a chat with him and he persuaded me this was the best place to be at the moment and I trusted him.''
The left-footed Aribo has drawn comparisons with Arsenal legend Patrick Vieira and models his game after former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Mousa Dembele.
Describing his strengths as a player, Aribo said:
''I am quite dynamic and can get up and down the pitch. I can get at players in a &lsquo;one v one&rsquo; and sometimes I can pick a pass and find the back of the net.''
The 22-year-old Aribo joined up with his new Rangers teammates in the Algarve on Thursday afternoon."
268,"Nigeria and Sporting Charleroi striker, Victor Osimhen, suffered an injury scare during the Super Eagles workout at the Arab Academy of Science and Technology and Maritime Transport on Thursday.
The forward who was lively in training today felt his groin after powering a shot past goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa in the opposing goal.
After the goal, the young striker went to the deck and was attended to by the medical team under the watchful eye of head coach Gernot Rohr.
The good news here is that the striker got up after receiving medical attention and continued with the training session.
Osimhen has yet to appear for the Super Eagles at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations but could be given a run-out against Madagascar on Sunday evening as the Gernot Rohr-led side are already through to the last sixteen.
Madagascar have moved to second on the table after beating Burundi 1-0 in their second Group B fixture played today."
269,"Nigeria have one of the most potent attacks in African football but have struggled to score goals at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations, netting twice in two matches.
Kenneth Omeruo who has become such an important player for the Super Eagles in Egypt scored off a corner kick to hand the three-time African champions a slender 1-0 win against Guinea on Wednesday.
Arsenal winger Alex Iwobi tested the goalkeeper from outside the box on two occasions while Oghenekaro Etebo and Odion Ighalo also had opportunities to break the deadlock before the game-winning goal from the Chelsea defender.
''I am not worried about the level of our attack because we had other opportunities to score. We had two nice opportunities to open the scoring in the first half,'' Rohr told reporters on Wednesday.
''If you remember our first goal (scored by Ighalo), it was for me one of the most beautiful goals in the tournament, the goal we scored the other day against Burundi, it was prepared.
''Today we scored from a set-piece, it's good for a coach to know that we can also score from set-pieces and corners. In the past we conceded goals from corners, if now we can score goals from corners I am very happy.''
The Super Eagles returned to the training pitch on Thursday to begin preparations for their next game against Madagascar."
270,"Abdullahi Shehu and Jamilu Collins have been ruled out of Nigeria's final group match at the Africa Cup of Nations against Madagascar on Sunday, according to manager Gernot Rohr.
Rohr has hinted that Chelsea Academy product Ola Aina and Porto-owned defender Chidozie Awaziem will continue as fullbacks in tomorrow's game and remains optimistic that Shehu and Collins will be available for selection for the knockout rounds.
''Collins and Shehu are on the way to recovery, they are having special training sessions with the physical coach and physio, even this morning,'' Rohr told reporters.
''I hope they will be available for the next game, not for this one. This one is too short, we don't want to take risks. We have enough players, 21 players.
''It is true that that they are fullbacks but Awaziem and Ola Aina did the job well, we didn't concede any goal so there is no reason to take a risk to bring them in tomorrow.''
While Shehu suffered a hamstring problem against Burundi last weekend which led to this substitution three minutes before half-time, Collins picked up an injury in the team's final workout before their AFCON opener."
271,"Chelsea icon John Obi Mikel will miss Saturday's Africa Cup of Nations round of 16 match between Nigeria and Cameroon at the Alexandria Stadium after sustaining an injury earlier this week in the loss to Madagascar.
Gernot Rohr has also confirmed that Bursaspor's Abdullahi Shehu won't be fit for the game against the defending champions while Jamilu Collins is available for selection having recovered from injury.
''About the injuries we have good news from Collins, he can play now, I don't know yet if he can start or not but he'll be on the bench with the group again.
''We have only the injury of our captain Obi Mikel, he will not be able to play this match tomorrow.
''Shehu is still receiving treatment, he has started training now but not able to play yet.''"
272,"Guinea star player Naby Keita is doubtful for their crucial last group game at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations against Burundi on Sunday after he suffered an injury in the very physical encounter against the Super Eagles.
Keita's ailment is a recurrence of a groin injury he suffered during the semifinal of the Champions League against Barcelona on May 1.
In the first half, the former RB Leipzig midfielder was in pains after a clash of legs with Kenneth Omeruo and he went down again after a challenge by Wilfred Ndidi before he subbed out in the 70th minute.
In a statement, the Guinean Football Federation have blasted the Super Eagles players for injuring Keita.
''The victim of several blows against Nigeria, Naby Keita saw the doctor on Thursday,'' FEGUIFOOT stated.
''Although there is no serious injury, Naby is very uncertain for the match against Burundi.
''He was left at the hotel to continue receiving treatment, while the rest of the squad trained on Friday.""
Kenneth Omeruo scored the game-winning goal for the Super Eagles three minutes after Keita was forced off injured."
273,"Elderson Echiejile&rsquo;s stay with the Finnish Veikkausliiga champions HJK Helsinki has come to an early end, as the club have announced that they have parted way with the Nigeria international.
The left-back joined the Finnish powerhouse as a free agent in March, penning a guaranteed one-year deal until the end of the 2019 season, but has decided to move on to pastures new.
Echiejile played five matches for HJK, scoring twice and providing one assist but did not get playing time in the last three games contested by the club in the league.
''HJK and Elderson Echi&eacute;jil&eacute; have terminated their contract and Elderson will not continue with the HJK team,'' HJK tweeted on Friday, June 28.
''We thank Elderson for his contribution to the team and the club and wish him all the best in the future. Thanks, Eddy.''
Aged 31, Echiejile was a member of the Super Eagles squad to the 2010 and 2018 World Cups and has 59 caps for the senior national team.
The Bendel Insurance product who lists Monaco, Rennes and Braga among his former clubs was a key member of the Super Eagles squad that won the AFCON in 2013."
274,"Super Eagles manager, Gernot Rohr, has rested several players against Madagascar with an eye on the round of 16 clash against the third-placed team in Group A/C/D or the runner up in Group F next weekend.
Of the line-up that started against Guinea on Wednesday, only six players have kept their places in the starting line-up and the big news is the return of influential midfielder John Obi Mikel who started the Africa Cup of Nations opener vs Burundi on June 22.
Goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi who started the first two AFCON games has been given a rest and Ikechukwu Ezenwa is his replacement in goal.
With fullbacks Abdullahi Shehu and Jamilu Collins unavailable due to fitness concerns, Chelsea Academy product Ola Aina and Porto-owned defender Chidozie Awaziem continue to deputize for the duo, while Troost-Ekong replaces Kenneth Omeruo and the Udinese star is partnered by Leon Balogun in central defence.
The remaining two midfield positions have been taken by John Ogu and Oghenekaro Etebo, meaning Arsenal star Alex Iwobi is on the bench.
Nigeria's leading goalscorer since the appointment of Gernot Rohr as coach, Odion Ighalo leads the attack and the former Watford striker is flanked by Samuel Kalu and Ahmed Musa.
Super Eagles Starting XI : Ezenwa; Aina, Balogun, Ekong, Awaziem; Ogu, Etebo, Mikel; Kalu, Ighalo, Musa"
275,"Super Eagles and Sporting Charleroi striker, Victor Osimhen, has admitted that he is learning the ropes from Chelsea icon John Obi Mikel ahead of a potential debut at the Africa Cup of Nations against Madagascar on Sunday evening.
By no stretch of imagination, Mikel is the most experienced player in the Super Eagles squad and Osimhen says he has been picking up tips from the five-time Africa Cup of Nations veteran.
The 2015 U17 World Cup winner has performed excellently in the training sessions leading up to today's big game, scoring brilliant goals against Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Daniel Akpeyi on Thursday and Friday respectively.
''I think professionalism [is what I&rsquo;ve learnt from the more experienced players] because like the captain [Obi], he has been nothing but a top professional for many years and you can see the way he organizes the team,'' Osimhen said to Busy Buddies Nigeria.
''It&rsquo;s not just about the coaching staff, it&rsquo;s not just about the player but about him also, his personality is on top of this world and he jokes with us whenever it is needed and I think for us he makes us comfortable around him to be able to speak with him, to be able to joke with him and laugh with him.
''I think for me there is no better feeling to justify this. I think the captain has been top in his way of leading us.''
Osimhen ended the 2018-2019 campaign as Nigeria's top scorer in the European Leagues with 19 goals."
276,"CSKA Moscow tailing Everton&rsquo;s striker OnyekuruRussian Premier League giants CSKA Moscow are looking to pull off an audacious move for Henry Onyekuru.According to the Mirror, the Muscovites have contacted Everton to declare their interest in signing the Super Eagles winger.Onyekuru joined Everton in the summer of 2017 from Belgian side KAS Eupen but he has yet to make his competitive debut for the Toffees because he has not been granted a work permit. The 22-year-old was first loaned to Anderlecht before he was shipped out on another loan for the 2018-2019 season.He scored 16 goals in 44 appearances at Galatasaray last term, helping the Istanbul club win the Super Lig and the Cup. The Turkish champions are interested in signing Onyekuru but face competition from clubs in France, Spain, Germany and Russia."
277,"Promising Nigerian midfielder Tariq Uwakwe has ended all speculation surrounding his future by inking a new deal with 2019 Europa League winners Chelsea.
The 19-year-old would have been a free agent on July 1 but has decided to extend his stay at Stamford Bridge.
Uwakwe has retweeted a post from Jamal Reid of Colossal Sports Management, who looks after him, confirming that he has accepted the offer of a new contract and penned the deal.
It is believed that an official announcement will be made by The Blues next month.
Bloverse.com previously reported that the central midfielder was offered to Lyon as he had wanted to explore other options but any proposed move is dead in the water for the time being.
Born in London, Uwakwe joined Chelsea Academy at U9 level and rose through the ranks before becoming an important member of the U23 team.
He represented Chelsea youth teams in the UEFA Youth League, Premier League 2 and EFL Trophy last season."
278,"Brighton &amp; Hove defender Leon Balogun has admitted that he was the player to be blamed for the opening goal scored by Madagascar in their Africa Cup of Nations match against the Super Eagles on Sunday evening.
The Islanders were handed a gift by Balogun who fumbled with a pass from John Ogu before Nomenjanahary pounced and rounded Ikechukwu Ezenwa to break the deadlock after 12 minutes.
Few minutes after his error, the Nigeria number 6 almost made another defensive blunder after a short pass to Ezenwa but the goalkeeper was quick to clear the ball out of danger.
''I made one mistake that led to a goal. I think I defended everything I needed to defend, I know people will now only focus on that mistake,'' Balogun told reporters in the mixed zone.
''I didn't make that mistake on purpose, definitely it does not feel good but as I said it happens. Today was just a bad day for the whole team.''
Balogun was not in the Super Eagles team that posted a shutout vs Burundi in their AFCON opener but has started and gone the distance in their last two games after Gernot Rohr opted to rest the reliable Chelsea star Kenneth Omeruo against Madagascar."
279,"Coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has admitted that Madagascar were the better side in Sunday evening's Africa Cup of Nations match at the Alexandria Stadium.
The Super Eagles had recorded back-to-back 1-0 wins against Burundi and Guinea but were outclassed by the Islanders who scored in each half to secure a 2-0 win.
''What happened was that Madagascar was the better team. We gifted them the first goal,we could not find a solution,'' Rohr said at the post-match press conference attended by our newsmen.
''We made five changes, I wanted to give some rest to some of our players who played so much especially Ndidi, Iwobi.
''Also we wanted to see the other goalkeeper. Usually when you are qualified before the third match, you give the chance to other players to play. That's what we wanted to do, to avoid injuries and second yellow cards.
''Madagascar played good counter football and we were not able to score even one goal, so that's why we have to work hard.
''The next match will be more important and the players know we have to work hard to improve to win the next match.''
Nigeria finished second in Group B with six points and will now face the runner-up in Group F in the round of sixteen on Saturday, July 6."
280,"Turkish Super Lig outfit Trabzonspor have announced the signing of Nigeria international John Obi Mikel, a statement on their official website reveals.
The Chelsea hero has penned a two-year contract, with the option to extend for a further year in the club's favour.
Mikel transferred to Tianjin Teda in January 2017, ending his close to 11-year association with Chelsea and returned to England to play for Middlesbrough in the January transfer window.
The defensive midfielder was in search of a new club following his release by the Riverside Stadium outfit, for whom he played 19 matches, scoring one goal on the final day of the regular season.
According to the agreement, Mikel will earn 1.5 million euros in his first season at Trabzonspor and another guaranteed &euro;1.5m in the second year of his contract (approximately N1.22 billion in Nigerian currency over the duration of his contract).
In the event that Mikel plays 70 percent of Super League matches for at least 45 minutes in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons, Trabzonspor will activate the option to extend his deal by a year and he'll pocket &euro;1.5m for the 2021-22 season."
281,"Chelsea and Nigeria international defender, Kenneth Omeruo, has become the longest-serving player at Chelsea following the sale of Czech Republic center back Tomas Kalas to Bristol City on Monday.
Kalas arrived at Stamford Bridge from Sigma Olomouc in July 2010 and departs The Blues after only four first-team appearances in nine years.
The title of the longest-serving player at Chelsea now belongs to Omeruo who joined Chelsea from Nigerian side Sunshine Stars in January 2012.
The Super Eagles star has remained loyal to Chelsea despite the fact he has yet to make his official debut for the club after seven years and six months.
Omeruo has been farmed out on loan to five different clubs:
ADO Den Haag, Middlesbrough, Kasimpasa, Alanyaspor and Leganes.
The 25-year-old, who is contracted to Chelsea for another one and a half years, has been linked with a permanent departure from the club in the summer transfer window."
282,"Chelsea-owned winger Victor Moses has resumed pre-season training at Turkish Super Lig side Fenerbahce amid speculation linking him with an exit from the club in the summer transfer window.
The former Nigerian international was among the player subjected to routine health checks at Liv Hospital in Ulus on Monday.
Moses underwent ECHO, exercise, respiration and function tests and was examined in all branches including cardiology, eye, ear-nose-throat and general surgery.
The former Crystal Palace man was heavily linked with a transfer to Inter Milan but it appears the deal is off with Inter Milan announcing the capture of Valentino Lazaro from Hertha Berlin on July 1.
Lazaro has the same technical characteristics as Moses as he can play as a right winger and the right wing-back role favoured by Nerazzurri new manager Antonio Conte.
Moses joined Fenerbahce on a season-long loan in January 2019 and the agreement between Chelsea and the Turkish club will keep him in Istanbul until the end of the 2019-2020 season."
283,"Super Eagles manager, Gernot Rohr, is sweating over the fitness of John Obi Mikel and few other defenders ahead of their next game.
The Super Eagles players returned to the training ground on Monday morning as they began preparations for their round of sixteen Africa Cup of Nations clash against a yet-to-be determined opponent on Saturday, July 6, reports say.
The former Chelsea star was clearly seen to have suffered an injury in the final group match against Madagascar, and was substituted after 59 minutes of the Super Eagles 2-0 loss to the Islanders yet it is not certain whether he will be able to play this weekend.
Mikel is not the only injury concern going into the Super Eagles next game as Bursapor defender Abdullahi Shehu is still recovering from a hamstring complaint.
On a positive note, Rohr suggested at the post-match press conference yesterday that German-based left-back Jamilu Collins could return to the starting line-up, having missed all the games played by the Super Eagles at the AFCON due to injury.
The Super Eagles recovery session on Monday lasted for about one and a half hours."
284,"It has been confirmed that the Super Eagles of Nigeria will play against Cameroon in a mouthwatering round-of-16 meeting at the Africa Cup of Nations come Saturday, July 6.
The Indomitable Lions finished unbeaten in Group F but were held to goalless draws in their last two matches against Ghana and Republic of Benin.
Though Cameroon had the same five points as Ghana, the West Africans had a better goal difference following their 2-0 win vs Guinea-Bissau on Tuesday, thanks to goals from Jordan Ayew and Thomas Partey.
Of the 22 previous meetings between Nigeria and Cameroon, the Super Eagles have a better head-to-head record, winning eleven games, drawing seven and losing four.
The defending champions beat Nigeria in the final of the 1984, 1988 and 2000 Africa Cup of Nations.
In the event that the Super Eagles beat Cameroon, they will face the winner of the Egypt vs 3rd Group D/E in the quarterfinals."
285,"Arsenal star Alex Iwobi believes the Super Eagles have performed well at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations as they achieved their first objective of qualifying for the round of 16.
The Hale End Academy product has figured in all the matches played by the national team so far in Egypt, starting the first two against Burundi and Guinea, and came off the bench vs Madagascar.
''I believe we have done well, it is not easy to come and qualify,'' Iwobi told the Super Eagles Media team.
''They said we were the favorites but we already knew that it was not going to be easy, Burundi and Madagascar played for the first time in the competition, they showed why they should be here.
''No game was easy but we were able to qualify and that's the main thing.''
Despite faltering in their final group match against Madagascar, Iwobi is convinced that the Super Eagles can beat Cameroon on Saturday evening.
''Of course even though we had a defeat in the last game it will give us a bit of humility and it will give us the hunger to go into the next game,'' he stated.
Against Burundi, Iwobi started as a right winger and operated as a playmaker against Guinea, and can also be deployed as a second striker."
286,"Cameroon head coach Clarence Seedorf has expressed his joy for having qualified Cameroon for the next round of the African Cup of Nations in Egypt.
Despite his elation, the AC Milan legend is worried about his team's blunt strike force, and much like the Super Eagles, the Indomitable Lions netted only two goals in the group stages but they have a better defensive record than the West Africans, with the highly-rated Ajax Amsterdam goalkeeper Andr&eacute; Onana yet to concede in the tournament.
Clinton N'Jie (Marseille), St&eacute;phane Bahoken (Angers), Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting (PSG), Karl Toko Ekambi (Villarreal), Joel Tagueu (Portugal Mar&iacute;timo) and Jacques Zoua (Astra Giurgiu) are the players classed as strikers in the Cameroon squad.
''I do not think of Nigeria (opponent in the round of 16), we just finished the match, I'm very happy because we qualified, but we were disappointed because we wanted to win the match, we completely controlled this match,'' Seedorf was quoted as saying by France Football.
''We have to improve in several details, especially in attack, we have to be smarter to create more opportunities, we have not conceded a goal yet, there are positive things for the future. ''
The Super Eagles have not lost to Cameroon since they were beaten 1-0 in a World Cup qualifier in August 1989."
288,"According to celebrated Italian sports newspaper, La Gazzetta dello Sport, Turkish champions Galatasaray are interested in signing Nigeria-eligible striker Stefano Okaka.
The former Italy youth-teamer has resumed pre-season training at Watford but could be set for another move after spending the second half of last season on loan at Italian club Udinese.
He was behind Troy Deeney, Andre Gray, Gerard Deulofeu and even Isaac Success in manager Javi Gracia's pecking order of strikers last term and with these players still at Vicarage Road, he might find first-team opportunities limited if he remains at the club.
Okaka impressed while on loan at Udinese, scoring 6 goals in 16 appearances including 11 starts.
Since transferring to Watford at the beginning of the 2016-17 season, the 29-year-old has made 13 Premier League starts and was a substitute in 23 matches.
Okaka lists AS Roma, Spezia, Fulham, Modena, Brescia, RSC Anderlecht, Sampdoria and Parma as his former clubs."
289,"Deportivo La Coruna and Cypriot First Division club Omonia Nicosia have reached an agreement for the loan of Nigeria international Francis Uzoho to the latter for the entirety of the 2019-2020 season.
The young Super Eagles goalkeeper has played for the first and reserve teams of Deportivo La Coruna and had an unsuccessful loan spell at Anorthosis Famagusta during the second half of last season.
Uzoho was caught in a health certificate scandal shortly after he joined Anorthosis Famagusta on loan and as a result he played only two official matches for the club.
He was Nigeria's first choice goalkeeper at the 2018 World Cup but is now number three in the pecking order of goalkeepers due to his inactivity for his clubs in 2019.
In the first half of the 2018-2019 campaign, Uzoho was on loan at Elche, where he posted three shutouts in 8 matches while conceding 11 goals.
The 20-year-old officially joined Deportivo La Coruna in 2017 from Aspire Academy."
290,"Ajax Amsterdam's Cameroon goalkeeper Andr&eacute; Onana had some words of praise for the Super Eagles ahead of a potential Africa Cup of Nations classic between both countries at the Alexandria Stadium on Saturday evening.
One of the stars of the Ajax side that reached the semifinal of last season's Champions League, Onana is predicting a difficult clash against the round of 16 opponents.
The former Barcelona glovesman is enjoying his best spell of form at international level as he is yet to concede in his last four competitive appearances for the Indomitable Lions.
On the flip side, Onana's teammates have lost their scoring touch, firing blanks in their last two group matches at the AFCON against Ghana and Benin.
''I expect them (Super Eagles) to play well, as always. It is a very good team. But we are ready. We continue to the end,'' Onana told Fox News.
''I'm excited. It's getting exciting. Everyone wants to play such a match. We will see what happens. ""
The Super Eagles have not lost to Cameroon in regulation time since they were beaten 1-0 in a World Cup qualifier in August 1989."
291,"Chelsea-owned defender Kenneth Omeruo has been rated as the top player in Group B of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations by Whoscored.com.
With a rating of 8.09, the Super Eagles number 22 was the most eye-catching player on parade in Group B.
Of the top six rated players in each group, Omeruo was the second best rated player behind Rennes' Senegal winger Ismaila Sarr (8.55), while Mali's Samassekou (8.05), Egypt's Trezeguet (7.84), Ghana's Jordan Ayew (7.75) and Morocco's Saiss (7.71) were the top players in Group E, A, F and D respectively.
Only players with two or more appearances in the group stage were considered for the honour.
Omeruo started and completed the first two group games played at the AFCON and was rested for the last game vs Madagascar as the Super Eagles were already through to the last 16.
No Super Eagles player has been selected by the Confederation of African Football in the best XI of the group stage and they also missed out on the eight players named on the substitutes bench."
292,"Gernot Rohr has made several changes to his starting line-up for the Africa Cup of Nations round of 16 clash against Cameroon at the Alexandria Stadium.
Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi has returned to the starting XI, meaning the only home-based player in the squad, Ikechukwu Ezenwa has to be content with a place on the bench.
Chelsea Academy product Ola Aina has been an ever-present for the Super Eagles at the AFCON and he will continue in his role as a left-back with Chidozie Awaziem slotting in at right-back, while Kenneth Omeruo partners William Troost-Ekong at the heart of defence.
Wilfred Ndidi and Oghenekaro Etebo will sit in front of the Super Eagles defence, with Arsenal star Alex Iwobi playing as an attacking midfielder.
As expected, Odion Ighalo has gotten the nod to lead the attack and the former Watford man is flanked by Ahmed Musa and Moses Simon.
Nigeria Starting XI : Akpeyi; Awaziem, Omeruo, Ekong, Aina; Ndidi, Etebo, Iwobi; Simon, Ighalo, Musa
"
293,"Following his brace against Cameroon, Odion Ighalo is three goals shy of breaking a Nigerian record at the Africa Cup of Nations that has stood for twenty-five years.
The single-tournament scoring record for a Nigeria player belongs to Rashidi Yekini who netted five times to help the Super Eagles win the 1994 edition of the AFCON.
Ighalo, who was the top scorer during the qualifying series, scored Nigeria's opening goal of the tournament against Burundi.
He couldn't increase his tally in the other group games against Guinea and Madagascar.
However, it was his two goals that helped the Super Eagles secure their place in the quarter final round of the campaign.
The China-based striker has now found the back of the net on three occasions with one assist and he currently occupies the first position on the scorers' chart.
Senegal's Sadio Mane, whose goal was enough to defeat Uganda on Friday, and the Nigerian forward have the same number of goals.
Other players present on the log include Micka&euml;l Pot&eacute;(Benin), St&eacute;phane Bahoken(Cameroon), C&eacute;dric Bakambu(DRC), Ahmed El Mohamady, Mohamed Salah (Egypt) and Jordan Ayew (Ghana) who are all on two goals.
The Super Eagles will meet South Africa, who surprisingly defeated the host country Egypt 1-0 on Saturday, in the quarter final round and Ighalo will hope to continue his goalscoring run."
294,"Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has insisted that Moses Simon got the nod to start ahead of Samuel Chukwueze in his side's hard-fought 3-2 win over Cameroon on Saturday evening because the Levante winger has better defensive qualities than the Villarreal starlet.
Trailing 2-1, the introduction of Chukwueze in the 61st minute changed the outcome of the game as the Super Eagles equalised before grabbing the winner five minutes after he subbed in.
''The question is easy to answer, you know when you have some offensive players like Oyongo, the left-back from Cameroon, who is coming forward all the time and you have an offensive strong player like Chukwueze but defensively not so good like Simon Moses, who plays in his club a more defensive position because they play 3-5-2,'' said Gernot Rohr at the post-match press conference.
''He's playing on the right or the left side, so we decided to start like this to have stability in the team and to bring in Chukwueze in the good moment. He came in after 16 minutes in the second half.
''I don't believe that it changed the result but it helped us to win and to score the two goals.''
The Super Eagles will now face South Africa on Wednesday, July 10 with a place in the semifinal at stake.
"
295,"Chelsea starlet Fikayo Tomori could become the most expensive Nigerian defender in history if transfer speculations are anything to go by.
The Daily Star is reporting that Burnley are hoping to clinch a &pound;15m deal for Tomori, who is also eligible to represent the senior national teams of Canada and England.
Should Chelsea agree to do business with The Clarets, Tomori will become the costliest defender eligible to represent Nigeria, surpassing the 12 million euros Inter Milan paid Auxerre for Taribo West in June 1997.
Tomori was loaned out to Derby County for the entirety of last season and was named the club's Player of the Year and spent the previous season at Hull City.
With Chelsea slapped with a two-window transfer ban, it is thought that the central defender is in the plans of new Blues boss Frank Lampard as he was included in the pre-season squad for games against Bohemians and St Patrick's Athletic FC this week.
Although Manuel Akanji is a Switzerland international and no longer eligible for the Super Eagles, he is the most expensive defender of Nigerian descent in history, costing Borussia Dortmund &euro;21.5 million when he was acquired from FC Basel in 2018."
296,"Odion Ighalo normally celebrates his goals for club and country by kneeling down and raising his hands with fingers pointed to the sky, signifying his appreciation to God.
The former Watford striker netted the opening goal in the 19th minute of Nigeria's 3-2 win against Cameroon at the Alexandria Stadium on Saturday evening and deviated from the norm after his trademark goal celebration.
Eighteen minutes into the second half, Ighalo equalised for the Super Eagles and performed a similar goal celebration, using his fingers to make a shape and this got fans curious as they could not figure out his true intentions.
It is understood that Ighalo's celebration was a love sign for his wife and kids.
The race for the Africa Cup of Nations Golden Boot award is tied four ways between Odion Ighalo, C&eacute;dric Bakambu, Sadio Mane and Adam Ounas with three goals each.
Since the end of the 2018 World Cup, the number 9 has tallied ten goals for Nigeria."

A breakdown of the amount shows that the Nigeria Football Federation will pay $12,500 per player as bonus for the victory over the defending champions, Captain Hosea Okunbor gifted the Super Eagles with the sum of $20,000 per player, while Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu showered the players with $5,000 each.
Aside the $37,500 per player, the President of AITEO Group, NFF's Optimum Partner, Mr. Benedict Peters weighed in with the sum of $75,000 for the entire team for the three goals scored, at $25,000 per goal as he promised before the match.

Femi Gbajabiamila; the Executive Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babatunde Sanwo-Olu; the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Emefiele were among the spectators that watched the Super Eagles win against Cameroon at the Alexandria Stadium.
The Super Eagles will face South Africa in their next AFCON fixture with a place in the semifinal at stake."
299,"Gernot Rohr has reiterated that the Super Eagles are the underdogs heading into the game, pointing out that Bafana Bafana secured a spot in the last eight after beating a strong Egyptian squad.
The gaffer and Odion Ighalo faced the cameras ahead of Wednesday evening's Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinal showdown against South Africa at the Cairo International Stadium, Cairo.
''We saw the Egypt vs South Africa game, we know South Africa very well because they were in our group for the qualifiers,'' said Rohr to reporters at Tuesday's press conference.
''When you beat Egypt in this circumstances with one of the best players in Africa, you will be full of confidence and they deserve to win, they were the better team.''
Nigeria will be full of confidence following their recent 3-2 win against defending champions Cameroon but Rohr has insisted that the players are not getting carried away as they remain humble.
''We had a good game against Cameroon, we also have confidence so we should expect a match of high quality.
''The strengths of our team are humility and fighting spirit, and even against South Africa it won't be easy.
''But we also have confidence because we scored three goals against a team who did not concede a goal in the group stage and who had a very good goalkeeper.
''We are confident also but for me South Africa is the favorite,'' Rohr said."
300,"The news of Tyronne Ebuehi&rsquo;s return to Benfica squad will certainly be a much celebrated one to Gernot Rohr and the Nigeria Football Federation as they can't wait to have the attack-minded fullback in the national team setup.
The promising fullback&rsquo;s career was on an upward spiral until he picked up an unfortunate injury which ruled him out of action for the whole of last season.
The 23-year-old recorded a tremendous growth in his career in the last two years.
He ignited his international career as he made his debut appearance for the Super Eagles of Nigeria.
His fame continued to rise among Nigerians after his wonderful display against Argentina in a friendly encounter prior to the 2018 World Cup.
He went on to feature for the three-time African champions during the World Cup in Russia, making him a substantial member of the Super Eagles.
His development doesn't end there, he surprisingly became a transfer target for Primeira Liga giants Benfica prior to the World Cup.
He reached an agreement with the club and was officially unveiled as Benfica player, a move that was widely applauded by many Super Eagles supporters.
Ebuehi, who was hoping to break into Benfica's starting lineup, suffered a cruciate ligament injury in their pre-season clash with Juventus.
The long-term injury prevented him from making his official debut for Benfica as he spent close to 12 months in the recuperating room.
However, the right-back is fully fit and he's ready to challenge for a spot in Benfica's right-back position in the new season."
301,"Super Eagles striker Odion Ighalo wants to emulate Segun Odegbami, Rashidi Yekini, Julius Aghahowa, Austin Okocha and Emmanuel Emenike by emerging the top scorer of the Africa Cup of Nations.
The former Watford star is one of the frontrunners for the 2019 AFCON Golden Boot award, having scored three goals along with Sadio Man&eacute;, C&eacute;dric Bakambu and Adam Ounas.
Though Ighalo is interested in being top scorer, he has stressed that he is putting the team first ahead of personal success.
''It will be nice but first I'll put the team ahead because if I don't win the Golden Boot and we win the trophy I'll be very happy because we are here to do that,'' said Ighalo at Tuesday morning's press conference.
''I am a striker, I want to score goals but if the goal does not come and we win the game, I'll be more satisfied.''
Ighalo is the leading Nigeria scorer since the appointment of Gernot Rohr as coach with 11 goals in competitive matches."
367,"Following incessant killings, church leaders in Nigeria have said that Christians are experiencing ""pure genocide"" as 6,000 people, mostly women and children, have been murdered by Fulani radicals since January.
In a press release made available to journalists, the Christian Association of Nigeria, (CAN) and church denominational heads in Plateau State said that ""What is happening in Plateau state and other select states in Nigeria is pure genocide and must be stopped immediately,""said
The church leaders said that ""over 6,000 persons, mostly children, women and the aged have been maimed and killed in night raids by armed Fulani herdsmen,"" which is prompting their cry to the government of Nigeria ""to stop this senseless and blood shedding in the land and avoid a state of complete anarchy where the people are forced to defend themselves.""
In the press release, they church leaders also pleaded with the international community, as well as the United Nations, to intervene in the Fulani attacks, fearing they might spread to other countries as well.
""We are particularly worried at the widespread insecurity in the country where wanton attacks and killings by armed Fulani herdsmen, bandits and terrorists have been taking place on a daily basis in our communities unchallenged despite huge investments in the security agencies,"" they added, saying President Muhammadu Buhari has failed to bring attackers to justice.
They referenced several mass-scale attacks this year, including the killing of over 2000 people, mostly Christians, at the end of June in raids carried out by the herdsmen on local area farmers near the city of Jos.
Although some international news media has sought to characterize the killings as a land conflict between community groups, the church leaders, along with major persecution watchdog groups such as Open Doors USA and International Christian Concern, have all said that Christians are being deliberately targeted.
""We reject the narrative that the attacks on Christian communities across the country as 'farmers/herdsmen clash.' The federal government has been so immersed in this false propaganda and deceit while forcefully pushing the policy idea of establishing cattle ranches/colonies on the ancestral farming lands of the attacked communities for the Fulani herdsmen as the only solution to the problem,"" the press release declared, accusing the government of also pushing such a narrative.
""How can it be a clash when one group is persistently attacking, killing, maiming, destroying; and the other group is persistently being killed, maimed and their places of worship destroyed? How can it be a clash when the herdsmen are hunting farmers in their own villages/communities and farmers are running for their lives?"" the church leaders asked.
""How can it be a clash when the herdsmen are the predators and the inhabitant/indigenous farmers are the prey? Until we call a disease by its real name and causatives, it would be difficult to properly diagnose the disease for the right curative medications.""
Different reports on the number of Christians killed in Nigeria since the start of the year have emerged.
The International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law, Intersociety,statedon Tuesday that a combined total of 1,750 Christians, along with non-Muslims, have been killed both by the Fulani herdsmen, and by Boko Haram radicals, who are a separate terror group.
Intersociety also warned of a genocide in its statement.
""Nigeria is drifting to [a path of] genocide through killing, maiming, burning and destruction of churches and other sacred places of worship, and forceful seizure and occupation of ancestral, worship, farming and dwelling lands of the indigenous Christians and other indigenous religionists in Northern Nigeria,"" it said.
Roman Catholic Bishop William Avenya of Gboko separately told charity Aid to the Church in Needthat the world cannot wait for a full-on genocide before deciding to intervene.
""Please don't make the same mistake as was made with the genocide in Rwanda,"" he pleaded, referring to the massacre of Tutsi people in Rwanda, where close to 1 million were killed in 1994.
""It happened beneath our noses, but no one stopped it. And we know well how that ended,"" Avenya said."
302,"South Africa coach Stuart Baxter has claimed that Bafana Bafana defenders will not man-mark Odion Ighalo when they face Nigeria in Wednesday evening's Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinal clash in Cairo.
The former Watford striker has been Nigeria's most influential player at the ongoing tournament, having a hand in four (3 goals, 1 assists) of the five goals scored by the three-time African champions.
And Baxter has revealed that one of the ways to nullify Ighalo's threat is simply to cut off supply to the Super Eagles number 9.
''We don&rsquo;t make individual plans for players in terms of man marking. We would solve that as a team,'' Baxter said.
''We would make it difficult for them (Nigeria) to play quality balls to their strikers and would defend like we normally defend.
''That is part of the ways you can make individual strategies to certain players. Being a central striker, Ighalo will fall into the back four as a unit, and we&rsquo;ll screen the midfield which will make it difficult for him.''
Ighalo specializes in scoring from inside the penalty area and all his international goals have come from inside the box with the exception of his opener in a 4-0 win vs Cameroon in September 2017."
303,"Nigeria are through to the semifinals of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations following their 2-1 win against South Africa with Udinese defender William Troost-Ekong netting the game-winner one minute from time.
Ekong was delighted to net his maiden goal at the Africa Cup of Nations and blamed bad luck for the goal conceded by the Super Eagles in the 70th minute, which needed a review from the VAR before the goal was awarded to the South Africans.
''I am very proud of the team today, I think we showed again great character, we were a bit unlucky with the goal, if Ighalo didn't touch the ball it would have been offside. I am very happy I could score a goal,'' Ekong said in the mixed zone post-match.
Nigeria had not beaten South Africa in the last five attempts and they stopped the Super Eagles from going to the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, prior to Wednesday's match in Cairo.
Ekong added : ''It's massive, before the game we showed South Africa enough respect. We said they are a good team, we are very happy that we won the game.
''We are on the right way but now we have another big task ahead. I am just very happy for the boys.''
Following their win vs South Africa, Nigeria have reached the semi-final in 15 out of the 18 Africa Cup of Nations tournaments they have qualified for."
304,"Nigerian wonderkid Joshua Oluwayemi has taken to social media to announce that he has penned a professional contract with English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur.
The goalkeeper was offered a new deal at the end of last season and ended speculation surrounding his future by committing his future to the North London club until June 2021.
Born in London, Oluwayemi has racked up 19 appearances in the U18 Premier League since his debut against Leicester City in August 2017, posting nine shutouts.
The 18-year-old featured in the U18 Premier League Cup and FA Youth Cup last season.
Although Oluwayemi has played internationally for England's U15 and U16 national teams, he has pledged his international future to Nigeria.
He comes from a family of goalkeepers as his father, Abiodun Ogunyemi, was a goalkeeper for Ogun State University and attended Federal Government College Odogbolu, while his sibling, Tobi is also a goalkeeper at Tottenham Hotspur."
305,"Chukwueze's Man of the Match display against South Africa last night continues to attract praise from pundits and former footballers across the world.
Former Liverpool star Don Hutchison is the latest pundit to shower praise on the youngster whom he believes is destined for the top.
According to him via his Twitter account, English clubs are expected to make a move for the youngster this summer as he has told many scouts and managers about the 20-year-old Villarreal winger.
""What a player mate. English clubs won't have the balls to go for him. I've told loads of scouts/coaches Etc about him! Going right to the top."" Hutchinson tweeted.
Chukwueze scored the first goal in yesterday's entertaining encounter to help Nigeria secure a spot in the semi-final round of the ongoing AFCON tournament in Egypt.
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was reportedly linked with a summer move for the 20-year-old star prior to the start of the competition."
306,"Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal are bracing up in the possibility of facing each other at Wimbledon 11 years after their epic final, Bloverse understands.
The world had almost cancelled all scenarios where these two greats would meet again and do battle on Centre Court again as Rafa and then Federer were struck down by injuries after years at the top of the sport.
Yet now they have proved the world wrong to see off a string of young contenders to maintain their dominance, and they know how big this last-four match will be for the sport.
""It's impressive to see how healthy he's stayed. A lot of them were saying, 'Oh, it's the end,' by 2008,&rdquo; 37-year-old Federer said about Nadal, ""Similar to me in '09. We're still here. So it's nice to play each other again.
""We haven't played each other in a long, long time on this surface. He's serving way different.
""I remember back in the day how he used to serve, and now how much bigger he's serving, how much faster he finishes points.""
For the Spaniard Rafael Nadal, now 33, his progress to this stage of Wimbledon did gives him a good old feeling:
""First of all, it is a great feeling to be back in the semi-finals, to be able to be playing at this level of tennis is great news.
""I'm very happy the way that we have managed to be in that round.
""Now to play against Roger always is a unique situation. It's exciting to be back on this court against him after 11 years.
""It means a lot for me and probably for him, too."
307,"Algeria have progressed to the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations after beating Ivory Coast on penalties and will be facing three-time African champions Nigeria in Cairo on Sunday, July 14.
Desert Foxes manager Djamel Belmadi could be without two of his key players when they play the Super Eagles.
Sofiane Feghouli and Youcef Atal had to be substituted against the Elephants after they suffered injuries; the OGC Nice fullback is all but ruled out of the tournament while the Galatasaray star is racing against the clock to be fit.
Speaking in the mixed zone after the quarterfinal match vs Ivory Coast, Feghouli was quoted as saying by Le Buteur :
''I do not know exactly the seriousness of my injury. But I will see with the national team doctor.
''Even though I will not be fit to play Nigeria, Algeria will have another warrior to play in this match.''
The Super Eagles beat Algeria 3-1 in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers in Uyo and were held to a 1-1 draw in the return leg but the result was overturned and the North Africans awarded a 3-0 win after FIFA punished Nigeria for fielding an ineligible player, Abdullahi Shehu."
308,"
Stoke City assistant manager Paul Hart revealed to the club's official site that the Potters coaching crew are happy with Etebo's performances at the ongoing AFCON tournament after reaching the semi-final round of the competition.
Stoke City are tipping the number 8 for club and country to start when the Super Eagles face Algeria on Sunday, July 14.
Hart admitted it's hard not having him around for the club's pre-season tour as he is an integral part of the squad.
''It&rsquo;s a double-edged sword really, because we are incredibly proud of him and what he is achieving, but it would be great to have him back,'' Hart said.
''We are so pleased for Peter though, he is a great lad and he will be back as soon as he possibly can.
''We will most definitely be looking after him and managing him correctly when it is he does come back.''
Etebo is the only Super Eagles player who has started and gone the distance in all the matches played by Gernot Rohr's men in Egypt."
309,"The merseyside Blue have reportedly placed a &pound;25m price tag on the head of Ademola Lookman amid interest from Bundesliga side RB Leipzig, reports Liverpool Echo.
Leipzig were initially interested in the youngster's services during last summer transfer window but both parties couldn't reach an agreement before close of the period.
The 21-year-old Lookman has failed to convince Marco Silva of his potential throughout last season and he is now linked with a move away from Goodison Park as he searches for greener pastures.
Since making his much-celebrated switch to the Merseyside club in 2017, the winger has played just 36 Premier League games with just one goal to show.
Meanwhile, he had a great spell while he was on loan at RB Leipzig where he scored five League goals from just 11 games.
His goalscoring display is definitely one of the reasons why the Bundesliga side are seeking a permanent deal for his signature.
The former Charlton Athletic wonderkid is currently with Marco Silva's squad in Switzerland, the venue of their pre-season training."
310,"British light-heavyweight Anthony Yarde will challenge for the WBO world title against Sergey Kovalev in Russia on August 24.
The news was announced by the Russian Boxing Federation on their official website.
The fight will take place at the 7,500 capacity Traktor Arena in in Chelyabinsk.
Hackney hitter Yarde, 27, has only had 18 fights since turning pro and will go in as the underdog against veteran champ Kovalev.
However, with 17 KOs from those fights, Yarde and his camp will be confident of upsetting the odds in the Russian's backyard and bringing the belt back to Britain.
The veteran -Kovalev- beat Eleider Alvarez in a rematch in February to win back the WBO belt after losing to the Colombian in 2018.
The 36-year-old Russian has only three defeats on his record, two against boxing legend Andre Ward and one against Alvarez.
He has won 33 times with 28 KOs, with one draw.
Yarde is the WBO Inter-Continental and European champ, and this has earned him the mandatory shot at Kovalev for the full WBO world title."
311,"Super Eagles and Arsenal midfielder, Alex Iwobi, believes that the fact that Nigerian squad is filled with young players who are performing at top level means there is great hope for a successful future.
Having secured a hard-fought 2-1 victory against South Africa on Wednesday, Iwobi and his international teammates are two games away from winning the trophy.
Nigeria are primed to reach the AFCON final for the eighth time in their history as they have not lost to their semifinal opponents Algeria on the field of play in 29 years, winning seven games and drawing two during that period.
Speaking to CAF's official website, Iwobi said:
''For long time now I&rsquo;ve been dreaming of winning this very important title with my team.
''I hope we can achieve this year&rsquo;s edition and even if we didn&rsquo;t do that this time we can achieve more in the future because we are a young team that includes many talents who have a brilliant future.
''I&rsquo;m positive we can do something great together in the coming years.''
The Algeria vs Nigeria semifinal match will be staged at the Cairo International Stadium, Cairo starting from 2000 hours Nigerian time.
"
312,"Algerian captain, Riyadh Mahrez, pointed out that the Super Eagles have an advantage as they faced South Africa on Wednesday while the North Africans battled the Elephants the following day.
It is fair to say that Nigeria are the favourites heading into tomorrow's fixture as they have never lost to Algeria on the field of play for 29 years.
''Yes, it's true that Nigeria is a very tough opponent. This is one of the favorites of this competition,'' Mahrez was quoted as saying by Le Buteur.
''Nigeria is always playing the leading role in the Africa Cup of Nations. First we will recover well because we will have a day less than them, then we will get to work to be on top of the day.''
The former African Footballer of the Year is optimistic about their chances of beating Nigeria and qualifying for the final.
Mahrez continued:
''Obviously, I am very optimistic like my teammates. We have achieved so far an exceptional journey in this AFCON.
''We have won a lot of games, that of Ivory Coast is the only one where we went to a penalty shootout.
''This drives us to be optimistic but we will base ourselves on work. We will prepare for this game well and give it all.''
Mahrez was in the Algerian side beaten 3-1 by Nigeria in a World Cup qualifier in Uyo in November 2016 and also started for the North Africans in the return leg."
313,"Gernot Rohr has been handed a triple injury boost ahead of his side's Africa Cup of Nations semifinal showdown against Algeria in Cairo.
It is believed that Africa Cup of Nations leading marksman Odion Ighalo, vice-captain Ahmed Musa and young defender Chidozie Awaziem are now available for selection after they participated in full training on Saturday.
The Super Eagles had been facing an injury crisis as the trio picked up knocks in the last game vs South Africa.
Abdullahi Shehu is still listed as doubtful as he was the only player that trained away from the group in today's workout.
The Bursaspor defender suffered a training ground injury on June 21 and has not made a single appearance for the Super Eagles at the AFCON since he was substituted just before half-time against Burundi.
Shehu was involved in an aerobic session as the rest of the players were being put through their paces by the coaching staff."
314,"When we went to Jaisalmer, we asked Jahir, our hostel owner, about the farthest sand dunes that he could send us to. He said that he had a very experienced guy who took Jahir's guests to dunes which were a day's ride away. Half of the journey was to be made by car and the other half by camel.
Jahir called his guide Afzal and told him to take us to the dunes the next day. When Afzal introduced us to his camel Michael Jackson, he said Michael is moody but friendly. I was to ride Michael for he seemed to have preferred women riders. I hopped on and off we went. The ride was long, and the sun was growling even in November.
We rode for five hours to arrive at the dunes where Afzal wanted us to camp and spend the night. As soon as we got off our camels, the sun started setting. Though Michael was busy scraping off dry leaves off the desert ferns, when he saw the sun disappearing away, he stopped eating. Michael walked thoughtfully soaking in the receding warmth of his orange friend. He followed the setting sun for about fifteen minutes with pensive expressions. And when the sun disappeared, Michael began plucking off the dry branches and leaves from the tall trees again.
But until then, I had clicked golden pictures of Michael, our reflective and friendly camel. "
315,"There was this fashion designer in my area when I was growing up. He was very good and his styles were unique. He was a genius. Customers came far and wide to patronise him. My mother was one of his customers. She wouldn&rsquo;t sew her clothes elsewhere because when you wear one of his designs, people will compliment you throughout that day.
He had one flaw though. It is procrastination. No matter how urgent you need your clothes back, he will not sew it until the last possible moment. This was despite the fact that he had several apprentices in the big building he used as his shop.
Eventually, his business collapsed and things went really bad for him. He bought a motorcycle in a desperate bid for survival and was using it for commercial purposes but got involved in an accident which rendered a leg useless barely months later!
Whenever I remembered this man, I also remember a Yoruba film I watched around that time. It was titled &lsquo;Aso Odun&rsquo;. For some reasons, I have never forgotten this film. The protagonist in the film was going through one calamity after another. His business went down the drain and he had to relocate back to his village from the city. He almost lost all his family in an accident, hunger set in and debts. At the end of the film, we found out he used to be a high profile fashion designer who took his clients for granted.
It happened that a set of clothes were given to him to sew for Odun Ileya (the Islamic big festival). It belonged to a couple of kids but this man didn&rsquo;t sew the clothes until the festival day arrived. Unknown to the man, one of the kids belong to an Ogbanje group and she was supposed to wear the dress for her coronation that night. She was automatically dethroned and she took out her anger on this protagonist and his family.
I don&rsquo;t know what was responsible for my mother&rsquo;s tailor&rsquo;s downfall but I do believe he was responsible for his own downfall. Pride goes before a fall. No business can survive without customer. The moment you start taking your customers for granted, you are building your own downfall!
Most business owners and artisans in Nigeria are like that. The moment they were able to build a large clientele, they start misbehaving. Even those with large followers on social media are not left out. They become rude and sassy to their followers.
A tree doesn&rsquo;t make a forest. A business cannot survive without customers. We can&rsquo;t live without our friends and family. No matter how successful we think we are, there is someone else who is more successful than we are. Always remember nobody is indispensable, even YOU!"
316,"I love solving puzzles. I love taking quizzes. It challenges my brain and tickles my curiosity. I also find them difficult to resist.
As a travel management consultant, we received quite a lots of knowledge training of products from airlines in the form of puzzles and quizzes. The quizzes can also be about tourism in their home base. They are usually full of fun and challenging. I looked forward to them. I have also been known to win most of this contest. This is always so frustrating to my colleagues.
When I completed the quizzes about South Africa tourism which was sent by South African Airline several years ago, little did I knew I just won the ticket for my first trip to South Africa.
I was having lunch a few days later when I received a call from an unknown number. The call was from a member of the South African Tourism board. I have just won an all-expense paid trip to South Africa. I was ecstatic.
The hitch in this travel plan was that the trip would commence in a few days&rsquo; time. This means I have to apply and get my visa within three days. Thank God I already have an existing yellow card. I have to be packed and ready to leave on the third day.
I didn&rsquo;t foresee any issue until the departure date. My ticket was ready but the visa wasn&rsquo;t out yet. I was in the office that fateful morning when I received a call that the visa was out. I was happy.
I was already planning how to spend the day. I would pick up my visa and go home to finish packing. I would branch to the mall on my way home and get some provisions. I would take my bath and changed my clothing. I would take a quick snack and start going to the airport.
All my plans evaporated into the air when I got to VFS office and was told that my visa had been transferred to the island. I got to VFS office on the island at noon, amidst the horrible traffic on the Third mainland road. It was a battle getting access into the VFS island office, especially with the usual crowd waiting for their Visas to be out. I got another bad news that my passport plus stamped visa had gone back to the mainland because I didn&rsquo;t turn up on time.
I wanted to die of frustration. I was miserable and frustrated. I was ready to give up, if not because of my passport that was at stake. I was on the bus, going back to the mainland when I received a series of calls on my phone.
The VFS mainland officials wanted to knows where I was because they closed by 4 pm. My manager and colleagues were calling from the office to know how far I had gone with my travel plans. My sister was calling to know if I was still traveling and I told her to pack my stuff in case I was able to make it. When I received a final call from the VFS office that they would be closing in 30 minutes time and I was still on the third mainland bridge, I broke down in the bus and cried!
I got to VFS mainland office at past 5. Someone was waiting for me, even though they were officially closed for the day. He waited because there was a direct order from South African tourism office that I should be attended to any time I got to their office.
There was no time to go back home. I headed straight to the airport as I put a call to my sister to meet me there.
On her way to the airport, she was held up in traffic. I paced the airport and watched the queue at the South Africa Airline counter gradually reduced. I couldn&rsquo;t check in because I didn&rsquo;t have my luggage. I wasn&rsquo;t even sure if I would be able to make the trip but I was determined to give it my best shot. My sister confirmed she was almost at the departure lodge when my phone battery blinked and died.
That was great. My head pounded, my stomach rumbled with hunger and I regretted ever taking the quiz. There were just a few people left on the queue. The counter was rounding up when my sister tapped me on the shoulder. I rushed into one of the restrooms close by to change my clothing. I found out she hadn&rsquo;t packed any underwear for me. She only packed the clothes and toiletries I left out on my bed. To make matters worse, my menstrual period took that moment to start. There was no time to complain. I changed my clothes and rushed out again.
The flight was ready to take off. There was no time to say Goodbye to my sister. I was the last person to check-in. I was lucky I had light luggage. We were rushed through immigration and into the plane. I exhaled with relief immediately I stepped into the plane and took a seat for the first time since I left the office. It felt like a million years ago!
When life suddenly become too unbearable to bear, it means you are closer to achieving your dreams than you realize. Don&rsquo;t give up yet! Try one more time and the ultimate price of success is yours!
It was the best one-week vacation I ever had!"
317,"That moment when everything in the world becomes non exisit and you feel at peace with nature. An experience never to be forgotten and to be told a thousand times. This was me and my little familty onroute to Chale Island, a surreal adventure, a one kilimetre tractor ride to the Island was certianly not on the list of things to expect but we where thrilled by it nonetheless.
You dont get to see this everyday, crossing the sea and seeing monkeys around with their little families just enjoying the habitant and minding their own business.It felt like an episode of Jungle book, going to a remote island on the indian ocean and being greated by monkeys and baboons.
Island life was just amazing, from the tractor ride, to being greated by monkeys and to the ocean sourounding us."

Yes I am smiling but broken
I am walking but broken
I keep moving yet I am broken
I still love even if am broken
A heart that was once whole
Is now broken
Not even laughter can seal the hole
When I first saw you
I knew me, was perfect for you
Like a teenager in love
All I could think of was you
I pictured us down the aisle
And there I was with you
Now a decade has passed
And am still caught in this web so cursed
The man I once knew
Is now so new
The man once of my dreams
Is now the source of my nightmare
Imprisoned in this stagmire
The stagmire of love

We were always drunk in love
But now you&rsquo;re never sober
Thus no room for us to drink in love
You never used to raise a finger on me
Lest tucking the hair behind my ear
Now your blows are like my daily bread
Your kicks are now the air I breathe
Your hugs, to me, are common like a feathered egg
An oath I took with too much love
Has now subjected me to clean your vomit
And wash your shit
Of course after daily beatings from the reason my heart beat
I miss you
I miss us
I still love you, I never stopped
For I am stuck in this stagmire
The stagmire of love

It's funny how it beats fast for someone you have known all your life, and it gets funnier when it beats for a stranger with the same magnitude. The only thing that you have to know and need to remember is what meaning the heartbeat gives to your life even as the wind blows south.
While we try so hard to define the meanings of and differences between friendship and love, we miss out on the best beats of our hearts. Rapid emotions are not the ultimate way of defining what it means to love and to be loved. A love radiated by friendship will always find comfort in the other directions when the wind blows south.
As the heartbeats increase, do not force your emotions to shut down. Sometimes the rate is because of that special someone whose phonecall brightens up your day, or that smile that melts your worries and hardships by bit, and even that someone that simply becomes your peace. When you can laugh at the silliest of things with someone; that is priceless. So live each of these moments, and let your heart beat for each special meaning because life is not a bed of roses and sometimes the wind blows south.
In times of adversity, never forget that the wind blew your heartbeats to some of the most beautiful destinations before blowing south. So smile at life and love. Because the memories of a heartbeat can change any south in the best direction.
So let your heart beat as fast as it can beat, and let your emotions wander as far as they can go because in life, sometimes, just sometimes, the wind blows south..."
321,"The hunting of whales is an ongoing controversial issue. These incredibly huge mammals have been hunted for years. Their meat is eaten in Norway, Iceland, Japan, Greenland, and by Intuits and other indigenous people in United States and Canada.
Whale meat is tender, melts in the mouth and according to people who consume the mammal; its flavor is between fish and beef. However, environmental and animal welfare groups say the meat contains dangerously high levels of mercury which is poisonous to humans.
Annual Whale slaughter is still a tradition on the Faroe Islands
Life on the Faroe Islands oscillates between modernity and ancient tradition, conditioned by the hostile climate of the North Atlantic, where almost everything that is consumed must arrive by ship. In these parts, whaling is part of the islanders&rsquo; identity. They do not feel the need to relinquish or justify their practices. In fact, once on the island, the international uproar condemning whaling is rarely discussed.
For more than four centuries, the dwellers of the remote Faroe Islands located 200 miles off the coast of Scotland have been killing pilot whales for blubber and meat.
There is a startling practice in which entire villages go out in boats, herd pods of pilot whales close to shore and then cut their necks, turning the waters red with blood.
After the hunt, which takes place every summer, the blubber and meat of the slaughtered animals is distributed among all the members of the community.
For years, animal rights activists around the world, including the non-profit organization Campaign Whale, have been railing against the practice of killing whales, calling it inhumane, barbaric and completely unnecessary.
It is important to note that pilot whales are not an endangered species.
However, the Faroese, who number around 48,000, are extremely protective of their cultural heritage and customs which dates back to the 1500s.
The hunt, known in the local language as 'gridadrap,' gets under way at dawn when a pod of whales is spotted off shore.
The hunters lure the animals to a predetermined beach by hitting the hulls of boats with metal and wooden clubs, and then get them on the hook
According to the locals, if it weren&rsquo;t for whaling, there would be no one living on the Faroe Islands resulting in the population dying of hunger
The Minister of Fisheries announced that as of May 2015 all persons taking part in the slaughter must take a course in the laws and correct procedures relating to the grinds, and possess the relevant license to kill.
Authorities have to be present, and they keep the tools used. They banned the use of synthetic ropes because they could snap and get stuck around the whale, like a rubber band.
More than 260,000 people have signed Blue Planet Society&rsquo;s online petition calling for a ban on hunting dolphins and whales in Japan and the Faroe Islands.
The campaigners say that most hunts are &lsquo;unregulated, illegal and unsustainable&rsquo; and kill off &lsquo;100,000 dolphins and small whales&rsquo; every year.
Activists have been urging the European Union to take action against Denmark over the Faroe Islands &lsquo;Whale Hunts.&rsquo;
&ldquo;One can measure the greatness and the moral progress of a nation by looking at how it treats its animals&rdquo;"

The worlds fastest land animal the Cheetah is the most endangered &ldquo;big cat&rdquo; in Africa.
About half of the world&rsquo;s cheetah population can be found in Southern Africa, in countries like Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. Cheetahs prefer dry and hot climates, but are not particularly fond of deserts or tropical areas.
Reports estimate that there are just 6,674 of the world's fastest mammals now left in the wild.
There is an urgent re-categorization of the species from vulnerable to endangered.
The cheetah is endangered due to habitat loss, poachers and low levels of genetic variation.
Cheetahs are in trouble because they range for beyond protected areas and are coming increasingly into conflict with humans.
Cheetahs tend to encounter conflict with farmers when loss of their natural prey leads them to attack livestock resulting in farmers killing them in retaliation and if the farmer does not put in proper fencing/defense against wild animal attacks, they will take that easy prey.
Poachers are out to kill the cheetah for their coat or for &ldquo;medicinal purposes.&rdquo;The medicinal purposes for killing animals is just a justification for people to kill an endangered animal.
Live cheetahs are caught and traded illegally to the pet trade and are also hunted for their skin. The East African region though unclear traders suggest that parts of Ethiopia and Kenya (and occasionally beyond) is where illegal trade in live cheetahs is most likely to have the greatest negative impact on wild populations.
Did you know: According to the Cheetah Conservation Fund the young cats can fetch up to $10,000 on the black market.
According to studies, Cheetahs in Asia have been essentially wiped out. An estimated number of 200 Cheetahs clings on in Iran in small isolated populations.
In Zimbabwe, the cheetah population has fallen from around 1,200 to just 170 animals in 16 years, with the main cause being major changes in land tenure. There are now about 80% of cheetahs confined to wildlife protected areas.
Cheetahs require large territories for hunting. And with decreasing habitats, these territories continue to overlap not only with other cheetahs territories, but with lion and leopard territory.
Lions kill their fair share of adult cheetahs and many cheetah cubs.
The mortality rate was at 70% for cheetah cubs in the wild. That's not many cheetahs surviving to adulthood.
Scientists estimate the cheetah has been driven out of 91% of its historic range.
The African Wildlife Fund provides both proactive and reactive strategies to prevent human-wildlife conflict. &ldquo;We work with local communities to construct bomas&mdash;enclosures for livestock that protect them from cheetahs. We also provide consolation funding to farmers who have lost livestock to cheetah predation.&rdquo;
AWF also engage communities living near cheetahs to create sustainable solutions for agricultural and settlement growth by providing incentives and training on best practices. This allows for both the big cat and farmers to have space in which to live without encroaching on one another.

323,"Rhinos have no predators but humans.
Rhinos are hunted and killed for their horns. The major demand for rhino horn is in Asia, particularly Vietnam. It is used in ornamental carvings and traditional medicine. Rhino horn is touted as a cure for hangovers, cancer, and impotence.
Northern white rhinos are one of two sub-species of the white rhino, the other being the Southern white rhino. Also known as the square-lipped rhinoceros, currently, the sub-species is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN&rsquo;s Red List of Threatened Species and &ldquo;Possibly Extinct in the Wild&rdquo;
A new study however, may hold the key to saving the northern white rhino's rapid descent into extinction.
The world's last surviving male northern white rhino died last year March 2018 after months of poor health. Nicknamed Sudan, who was 45, lived at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. He was put to sleep after age-related complications
The Ol Pejeta Conservancy acquired northern white rhinos two males and two females in 2009 from a zoo in the Czech Republic. Both male northern white rhinos died, leaving the fate of the subspecies on the female rhinos.
The death of the last northern white male rhino, Sudan, is said to have catalysed scientists efforts to come up with technological innovations that could potentially save northern white rhinos from extinction.
The process, would involve researchers, scientists and conservationists from different countries, with Kenya as a key destination where ovum pick-up will take place.
Conservationists have adopted artificial fertilisation in efforts to breed northern white rhinos. Scientists are expected to pick ova from the world&rsquo;s remaining two female northern white rhinos in Nanyuki.
They will try and develop a way to safely remove egg cells from remaining females, fertilize these with semen collected from northern white males, and use a female southern white rhino as a surrogate.
Ol Pejeta Conservancy head of wildlife Samuel Mutisya, said the procedure, which was expected to take off in 2018, is technical and requires a lot of planning and logistics.
This has never been done before, and does not come without risks. What's more, if the remaining females die before this method has been developed, one of the last chances to save the northern white rhino will vanish.
&ldquo;When they are gone, when every last life has been stolen, how will you remember them?&rdquo;"
324,"Giraffes are at risk of extinction as they are given &ldquo;critically endangered&rdquo; status for the first time.
As of 2018, Giraffes have been declared critically endangered in Kenya. According to the Nairobi Wire, the National Recovery and Action Plan for Giraffes has been set up to combat the decline of the animals due to poaching, habitat loss and climate-shock diseases.
60% of the world&rsquo;s animal population has been wiped out by human activity in the past 40 years.Kenya has lost 40% of its giraffe population in the past 30 years with only 659 Rothschild&rsquo;s giraffes remaining.
There are approximately 8,700 reticulated giraffes, also known as Somali giraffes, in southern Somalia and southern Ethiopia and approximately 2,645 Nubian giraffes, mainly found in west central Kenya, South Sudan, western Ethiopia and northern Uganda.
&ldquo;Whilst giraffes are commonly seen on safari, in the media and in zoos, people including conservationists are unaware that these majestic animals are undergoing a silent extinction,&rdquo; Julian Fennessy, the co-chair of the Species Survival Commissions Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group says in a press release.
Jani Actman on National Geographic reports that many giraffes are slaughtered just for their tails, which are considered a status symbol and have been used as a dowry when asking a bride&rsquo;s father for his daughters hand in marriage in some cultures.
The Kenyan government has launched a land-use programme to secure the habitats of endangered giraffes. However, increasing funding for anti-poaching efforts can do some good, stopping habitat encroachment is a much more difficult prospect, since it would mean interfering with land development, mining and other economic activities and livelihoods.

The biggest problem for giraffes though, may be the lack of attention over the years.
Giraffes have silently been going extinct across Africa over the last century. The animal is already gone from seven countries, Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal. Furthermore, the &lsquo;National Recovery and Action Plan for Giraffes&rsquo; was launched as of 2018 until 2022. The initiative aims to address challenges for the sustainable conservation of giraffes in Kenya.
&ldquo;Each and every animal on Earth has as much right to be here as you and me&rdquo;
We have an obligation to protect Giraffes."
325," Plastic bags pollute our land and water. Because they are so lightweight, plastic bags can travel long distances by wind and water. They litter our landscapes, get caught in fences and trees, float around in waterways, and can eventually make their way into the world's oceans.
The real impact of plastic bag litter is felt on wildlife both marine environment and in the rural areas .
There are 5 ocean gyres in the world where plastic gathers due to current circulation. These gyres contain millions of pieces of plastic and our wildlife feed in these grounds.
Tens of thousands of whales, birds, seals and turtles are killed every year from plastic bag litter in the marine environment as they often mistake plastic bags for food. 
Plastic bags once ingested cannot be digested or passed by an animal so it stays in the gut. Plastic in an animal's gut can prevent food digestion and can lead to a very slow and painful death. 
It is now believed that there are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic debris in the ocean. Of that mass, 269,000 tons float on the surface, while some four billion plastic microfibers per square kilometer litter the deep sea. 
Shoppers worldwide are using approximately 500 billion single-use plastic bags per year.
This translates to about a million bags every minute across the globe, or 150 bags a year for every person on earth. And the number is rising.
World wide, 13,000-15,000 pieces of plastic are dumped into the ocean every day.
Ocean acidification is a growing problem. 
Scientists have identified 200 areas declaws as &ldquo;dead zones&rdquo; where no life organisms can now grow. 
Every year, 6.4 million tonnes are dumped into the ocean. This is the same as 3,200 kilometres of trucks each loaded with garbage.
At least two thirds of the world&rsquo;s fish stocks are suffering from plastic ingestion. 
Australia alone uses 6.9 billion plastic bags a year of which 3.6 billion are plastic shopping bags. Australians dump 36,700 tonnes of plastic bags into the landfill every year. That equates to 4,000 bags a minute or 230,000 per hour. It costs the Australian government in excess of $4 million to clean up plastic bag litter each year. If each Australian family used 1 less plastic bag each week that would be 253 million bags less a year. Less than 1% of plastic bags in Australia are reused 
The floods in Bangladesh in 1988 were made more severe because plastic bags clogged drains. The government has now banned plastic bags.
In Ireland they introduced a 15 cent plastic bag tax and reduced their usage by 90% in one year. It is now 22 cents. 
As of 2017, Kenya plastic bag ban came into force after years of delay.
Kenya has inspired four more countries to ban plastic bags.
South Africa, Chile, Oman and Sri Lanka want to follow in Kenya&rsquo;s footsteps.
They announced new measures including plastic bags bans, marine litter and ocean pollution. 
&ldquo;For too long, we have treated the ocean as a bottomless dumping ground for plastic, sewage and other waste,&rdquo; said Erik Solheim, head of the UN Environment Programme.
Nearly 40 countries from Kenya to Canada and Indonesia to Brazil have joined the #CleanSeas campaign, which aims to counter the deluge of plastic trash that are degrading oceans.
The countries account for more than half of the world&rsquo;s coastline.
Did you know: Plastic from bags, straws and takeaway coffee cups we use everyday are already making their way into the stomachs of fish, and now they have entered the food chain. We are consuming them too. 
Prevention is better than cure
When we ban plastic bags, we keep our environment clean and at the same time send a message globally about the importance of environment protection. People learn that banning plastic is for a reason and they can take up such important information. They can subsequently begin to understand that the plastic causes some negative effects and the environment and humans need protection against them. 
Over 40 nations together with municipalities around the globe have instituted plastic bag bans. Other nations should follow suit to reduce the overall environmental implications. "
326,"Elephants to me are the worlds most majestic creatures. Traits associated with the elephant are: strength, wisdom, solitude, loyalty and intelligence.
Seeing and walking with Elephants at the Ol jogi Conservancy, Nanyuki, Kenya was one of the most pleasant experiences of my life. Seeing Elephants standing proud and tall, ears twitching with merriment takes me back to the old saying &ldquo;saving one animal will not save the world but surely, for that one animal the world will change forever&rdquo;
There are parts of me that feel blessed at never having seen an Elephant at a zoo or behind a cage.
Elephants are a reminder that you are stronger than you think. They remind us to learn from our past so as to not repeat the same mistakes and with their poor eyesight and strong sense of smell they teach us to trust not what we see but instead to trust our other senses."

WE LOVED THEM BUT GOD LOVED THEM MORE...
They say that death is not the greatest loss in life and that the greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live. Loosing someone we love is a path no one wishes to have but it is a part of life. Moving on is also a necessity that is required in order to live happily for the rest of our existence. The fact that someone took it upon themselves to open up their heart and love someone else. The risk factor of this action comes when we loose them. Loosing someone you love always feels like everything that ever made you happy was just gone. Some will tell you that it gets better, you just have to take one step at a time, others will explain how they felt when they also lost someone and others will just do the right thing; hold your hand and give you a shoulder to cry on.


It is said that the most painful goodbyes are those that were never said or explained. It is true but sometimes the most painful goodbyes are those that leave no happy memories behind. This is because some of us spend more time mourning our loss and forget to celebrate the life our loved ones led. We need to remember what they stood for, what made them happy and what they would have wanted us to do. I f we wish death upon ourselves, then who is going to remain on this earth that will remind us of the memories that were created prior to the deaths of our loved ones? Isn't it nice when you buy a flavour of icecream and it reminds you of how your departed loved one used to react when they bought that particular flavour?


A question that someone once asked is; How can the dead be truly dead when they still live in the souls of those left behind? Another definition of a legacy is; the act of looking at the impact one left on those who were dear and still alive. Sometimes strength is drawn from the life of a departed loved one and it can at times lead to a reborn soul on those that loved and lost.


The question that remains for many is; Is it better to have loved then lost or is it better to just avoid loving another altogether?

328,"
Today I asked a question which is as follows; While most women say they cannot date broke men, Is it okay for men to also say they can't date broke women? This is a question that has received mixed reactions with some saying that some men prefer broke women, because they cannot stomach women who earn more than them. Among the comments was one who pointed out that because men are considered providers and protectors, it is embarrassing for one to be broke and that it really does not matter if the woman is broke. Finally, one comment really spoke to me, this particular lady wrote on both parties actually bringing in their own finances so that they will not overshadow what both of them really want from their union: LOVE!
I always say, ""A woman can make you or break your spirit!"" I have not yet changed my thinking yet! Some women actually are in it for the long haul, be it in sickness or in health till death do thy part, they build you up to your full potential while in the process building themselves up too. Other women are natural movers, they just come to take and selfishly build themselves up while leaving your life in shambles. Each woman has a different technique than the other, but their goals are slightly similar. It's not revenge! It's just how some were brought up believing, others are just spoilt, most just follow what they see in society and the rest differ or just want quick fame, cash and lifestyle.
In this modern fight to equalize women with men, the rules of the game are not as white and black anymore. The struggle between female builders and movers is one that has been going on for so long. The builders fight for what they believe is rightfully theirs but the movers respond saying that these men belong to both of them! Female movers state that when these men are with you, they are our but when they leave your house, they belong to every female around. They support their claim by commenting that one cannot put a leash on a man! With this kind of argument, what do you think builders will do?
Quinn Loftis once said, "" If you can't beat them, join them!"" Some Female Builders decide to join the other side so if you ever meet a mover, they might be builders deep deep down! Someone might ask if this logic is right and why there are some builders who leave their men's lives in shambles. On thing to note is, Movers can be both patient and impatient! Some start the journey with you but deep down they saw potential and all that you can offer such that when the time is ripe; they harvest what they sowed. So the question is, are you a builder or mover? Do you know of one? Do you think the theory of female movers and builders is right?

329,"Last year in season of bloom, I got 5 days of holiday from my university thus to spend this free time, I planned to go back to my hometown which is in UttarPradesh. I was all alone on the station waiting for my train and as there was noone to converse with, I was noticing my surroundings and found number of trains were passing through the Jalandhar station. Out of nowhere a question arouse in my mind that why am I staying so away from my family ? Why did I come to such distant place just to pursue my studies ?
At that point of time series of moments run through my mind like a slideshow. Like why inspite of so much hardwork I have not scored the desirable percentage in my boards? Why inspite from being science background and effictively good in studies I have not opted for engineering ? Why have I not found English Journalism and Mass communication in a specific university I had applied in? Why just before the very last phase of admission I got to know about this university in which I am presently studying ?

331,"It was 10 on a certain Thursday morning somewhere in Nigeria&rsquo;s Federal capital- Abuja. But while many went about their daily duties, Mama Baraka, sat on one side of a flyover. She does not intend to leave anytime soon. Seated with her were 7 children which I would later discover belonged to her.
My attention was drawn to her when one of her children- the last among them tapped me and said &ldquo;uncle please help me and my mother. We have not eaten today. We are hungry. If you help us, God will bless you&rdquo; as I tried to use the flyover to cross to the other side of the road.
Every morning, Baraka as she is fondly called brings her children to the flyover where they sit and lie in wait for passersby who give them money. The do not even have a place to call home. And so, they have to wait till the evening hours when owners of shopping malls retire from the day&rsquo;s transactions before they go to sleep.

The mall where the women sleep at night
Every day, she comes out with the hope of making money- that will be enough at least to take care of her basic needs like food, soap for washing cloths and water to drink. But sometimes, she gets disappointed as nothing comes in. She is not the only one who begs to earn a living.
Globally, over three billion people, 50% - live on less than $2.50 (N900) a day and despite having one of the world&rsquo;s highest economic growth rates, averaging 7.4%, over 86.9 million Nigerians live in extreme poverty representing nearly 50% of its estimated 180 million population.
By this figure, Nigeria has overtaken India- which has 5 times its population- as the country with the most extreme poor people in the world according to a new report by The World Poverty Clock.
According to World Bank standards, living in extreme poverty is living on less than $1.90 (N680) per day. People living in extreme poverty are those who are unable to meet even the barest minimal needs for survival.
Baraka, 43 left Daura in Katsina, a state in Nigeria&rsquo;s North West where she made kuli kuli (a northern Nigeria snack that is made from dry and roasted groundnuts) after her husband got involved in a ghastly road accident and died 3 years ago.
She tells me that everything was just fine when her husband was still alive because he always made efforts to provide for her needs and that of her children. But life soon, became somber and blares after he died.
&ldquo;After his death, there was nothing to do. We had no food to eat and so I had to come down here with my children after a friend advised me. I did not want to remain at home dong nothing&rdquo; she said.
She spoke of how one of her children fell sick at some point and she almost lost her because there was no money. All thanks to someone who helped her with some money and saved the life of her daughter.
Now, 2 of her children sale sachet water on the streets- a business which she started with the little money she was making. But she hopes they will stop soon and things will get back to normal.
She described her experience in the past 3 years as harrowing and said she wants her children to go to school, become better citizens and wipe away her tears and bring joy to her soul.

While addressing journalists during a daily Media/Stakeholders Update, preparatory to the ""2019 Gubernatorial/State Assembly Election in the state, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Emeka Ononamadu said that the commission had concluded other plans to ensure that the exercise is completely free, fair and credible and that they people will be happy at the end.
&ldquo;They arrangements we have been making since this week goes to show that the INEC in Enugu state is ready for the election and determined to commence on time unlike what was experienced during the presidential and National Assembly polls&rdquo; he said.
Ononamadu also stated that the commission has put up a service monitoring team that will ensure that elections across the state begin as early as 8 so people can come out and cast their votes and also wait for the votes to be counted and the results announced.
He however regretted that some politicians have continued to engage in vote buying which is completely against the electoral laws, insisting that the commission was in support of any action intended to prevent the act during the polls on Saturday.
He appealed to electorates and party agents to conduct themselves in the most orderly manner during the polls as elections are not a do or die affair.

Speaking during the daily Media / Stakeholders Update, preparatory to the election in Enugu state, the National Commissioner of INEC, Festus Okoye stated that the smart card reader is important as it is used for verification and authentication to avoid cases of unregistered voters coming out to vote.
Okoye who said he was visiting Anambra, Benue and Enugu states to ascertain the level of preparation towards the election and to assure the people of INEC's readiness to conduct a free, fair and credit election affirmed that the governorship and state Assembly elections are very important because they are closer to the people at the grass roots.
""We hope to improve on the conduct of the last election by ensuring the early deployment of our staff, uniform application of smart card readers and improvement of the collection process"" he said.
He however condemned the manner in which over-ambitious political aspirants heat up the process by sponsoring political thugs, adding that the commission would no longer tolerate further killing or maiming of its ad hoc staff.
""We are working closely with the security agencies to ensure that anyone who is found trying to disrupt the elections by beating up our ad hoc staff members will be dealt with"". He said.
He Said It was unacceptable for any party to coerce electrical officers into announcing results that do not reflect the wishes of the people.
He also warned that any electoral officer who fails toplay by the rules of the game as established by the INEC and decides to get involved in electoral malpractice will be dealt with.

It would be recalled that there were widespread intimidation and harassment of staff of the commission in the last presidential and National Assembly elections.
There was the case in Imo of Francis Ibeawuchi, an INEC returning officer for the Imo west senatorial election who said he was &ldquo;forced&rdquo;to announce Rochas Okorocha, Imo state governor, as winner of the poll.
Reacting to this, Yakubu said the commission will not tolerate the intimidation of its staff during Saturday&rsquo;s elections.
&ldquo;I am confident that working together with the security agencies, we will consolidate on the largely peaceful conduct of the presidential and national assembly elections while also taking decisive steps to deal with the minority of violators intent on disrupting the conduct of peaceful elections,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;However, the commission will not tolerate the act of holding our officials hostage and forcing them to declare winners under duress. Where such occurs, the commission will not reward bad behavior by issuing them certificates of return.&rdquo;
The INEC chairman also stated that the commission had put in place necessary measures to ensure that voting starts at exactly 8am to enable electorates cast their votes, monitor as they are counted and listen as winners are announced.
He said materials for the election have been delivered to all states and the FCT and movement to the local government areas to be completed before Friday.
&ldquo;By tomorrow, all materials and relevant personnel will arrive at the Registration Area Centres (RACs),&rdquo; he said, adding: &ldquo;With this arrangement, we are confident that all polling units will open at 8am nationwide.&rdquo; He said.

The tribunal also denied Atiku&rsquo;s request to be allowed to conduct a forensic examination and forensic analysis of the materials and have access to card reader data and information contained in the cloud and electronic storage used for the poll.
Atiku had rejected the result of the election claiming that the results had being manipulated in favour of incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari. Following the announcement of his disapproval of the results, the PDP candidate filed a legal suit against INEC.
Delivering the lead ruling, Justice Aboki said by virtue of the provision of section 151 of the Electoral Act on which the applicants&rsquo; motion ex parte was anchored, they were only entitled to inspection of the electoral materials and the certified true copies of all the materials used for the poll.
PDP and Atiku had in their petition asked the tribunal to order INEC to surrender all the materials that were used for the February 23 presidential election for inspection.
The petitioners in an ex-parte motion dated March 4 and marked CA/A/P/EPT/1/2019, prayed for leave of the tribunal to allow them inspect the Voters Register, the Smart Card Reader Machines, Ballot Papers and other vital documents used in the conduct of the presidential election.
Equally, they asked that INEC be compelled by the Tribunal to allow their agents scan and make photocopies of vital documents used in the conduct of the election, for the purpose of establishing alleged irregularities.
According to their counsel, Chris Uche (SAN), the reliefs which the petitioners&rsquo; sought against INEC was for the purpose of filing an election petition they intend to level against the outcome of the 2019 presidential election.
The applicants&rsquo; legal team was led by Mr. Livy Ozoukwu (SAN), but Chief Chris Uche (SAN), made submissions on behalf of the team.
As expected in an ex parte hearing, the respondents &ndash; President Muhammadu Buhari, the All Progressives Congress and the Independent National Electoral Commission &ndash; were absent and not represented by their lawyers.
During the proceedings, members of the panel expressed reservations&lrm; about whether the tribunal could grant some prayers contained in the application for orders allowing them to scan and photocopy electoral materials as well as allow them to conduct forensic examination and forensic audit of the materials.
Responding, Uche insisted that there were authorities of the Court of Appeal &lrm;which had interpreted section 155 of the Electoral Act to mean that petitioners could be granted all the prayers sought in the ex parte application.

336,"Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that those opposed to the decision of Atiku Abubakar to seek legal redress over the outcome of the presidential election have evil minds.
It will be recalled that Atiku, who contested under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in the presidential election, lost to President Muhammadu Buhari.
Speaking on the judgement of the Osun governorship tribunal, Obasanjo said Atiku did the right thing by challenging Buhari&rsquo;s victory.
He said without a reasonable cause, Buhari went to the court to challenge his loss in three elections, wondering why some people were trying to &ldquo;stop Atiku from going to court&rdquo;.
On Friday, thetribunal declared Ademola Adelekeof the PDP as winner of the September 2018 election in the state.
In a statement on Saturday, Obasanjo said the nullification of the election, which he described as an illegality, has given renewed confidence in the judiciary.
According to him, &ldquo;While I was in Dubai to attend the Global Education and Skills Forum meeting, I received the news of the judgment of the Osun State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal declaring Senator Ademola Adeleke, the candidate of the People&rsquo;s Democratic Party (PDP), the winner of the 2018 Governorship election in the state,&rdquo; Obasanjo said.
&ldquo;Let me take this opportunity to commend the tribunal for its courage in nullifying what was clearly an illegality. This action by the judicial officers, albeit a first step in the legal process, gives renewed confidence in the judiciary at a time when there are coordinated efforts by some political leaders to undermine, if not destroy, it.
&ldquo;As I have repeatedly said, the world is watching events in Nigeria with keen interest. What we do or do not do right in our electoral process will have implications not just for Nigeria but for Africa and indeed the world. By correcting what was clearly a desperate attempt to change the will of the Osun people, the tribunal has saved Nigeria from great embarrassment and started the process of saving and strengthening our democracy.
Speaking further , he said &ldquo;Let me also commend Sen. Adeleke for his statesmanship in going to court to seek justice. This is the right and proper thing to do in any decent society. Going to court must be encouraged and not discouraged as some people are now attempting to do.
&ldquo;And if Buhari could go to court three times to seek justice, even without reasonable cause, any Nigerian who feels denied of justice must feel free to go to court.
&ldquo;Those who have conceived and are promoting the narrative that if Atiku Abubakar continues to seek legal redress there will be violence, are evil minds looking for excuse to unleash violence on Nigerians. At no time in history has sustainable peace been built on theft, injustice, corruption and inequity.&rdquo;"
337,"On the 16th of February, Nigerians will again head to the polls to elect a new president who would steer the sheep of state for the next four years. Since the new year, the various candidates have been engaged in extensive preparations for the election.
The 2019 presidential election- it has been widely held- may go down in history as one of the most keenly contested giving the large number of candidates vying for the country&rsquo;s no one position and the extent of competition between the two frontrunners, incumbent Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and a former vice president Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
Data from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) shows that a total of 73 candidates are jostling for the votes of Nigerians to become Nigeria&rsquo;s president. This figure is obviously the highest in the history of presidential elections in Nigeria, even though the election is going to be the usual two-horse race which has characterized presidential election in the country since return to constitutional democracy in 1999.
Incumbent President Buhari and his main opposition, Atiku Abubakar, stand out among other presidential candidates on account of their visibility all over the country; the national spread and entrenched structure of their political parties, among other factors.
Many believe the 2015 presidential election was largely won, not only because all the 15 million Nigerians who voted for President Muhammadu Buhari believed in him, but they just wanted former President Goodluck Jonathan voted out by all means.
Jonathan's administration was loathed for its inability to stem the tide of insurgency in the North and in the words of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, &ldquo;anybody except Jonathan&rdquo; would do. This drove many to vote President Buhari, giving him victory in his fourth attempt at the presidency.
We are beginning to see thesame scenario that played out in 2015 ahead of the 2019 polls with the level of complaints by millions of Nigerians about increasing security challenges, widespread hunger, biting poverty and unemployment, ;leading to youth restivenes.
Will Nigerians, in a move reminiscent to the 2015 election, vote out another incumbent over the growing disaffection in the land? Only the outcome of the Saturday polls can asnwer that.

338,"Members of the All Progressives Congress, APC on Friday demanded the immediate resignation of the Resident Electrical Commissioner, REC of The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC in Enugu state, Emeka Ononamadu.
They aggrieved supporters were led by the State chairman of the party, Ben Nwoye who alleged at the Commission's headquarters that the REC had connived with other paid agents in the People&rsquo;s Democratic Party, PDP and removed the name of Ayogu Eze who is the candidate of the party.
He alsostated that the REC transmitted election materials from the CBN to the 17 local governments in the state without the supervision of other political parties except the PDP.
""You have depressed the voters and our supporters. You have achieved your evil intent. We and indeed the entire people of Enugu state do not have confidence in you again"" he said.
It will be recalled that a Federal High court sitting in Abuja nullified the candidature of Ayogu Eze and ordered the INEC to recognize George Ogara as the candidate of the party.
Nwoye however said that an Appeal court in Abuja has set aside the judgment of the Federal High Court which had earlier affirmed George Ogara as the APC governorship candidate of the state.
""Eze is back but at this time you cannot repair the evil you have done. You are deeply compromised. ""We deserve for youto resign from your position as the REC of the state. We have lost hope in your ability to conduct a free and fair election"".
They supporters also demanded that the Saturday electionbe shifted and a new date fixed to enable the commission include the name of Eze as the party's candidate.
Reacting to this, Ononamadu said that theelection on Saturday is non-negotiable and no amount of threat can stop the conduct, insisting that the court had asked the party to summit the name of another candidate after Eze was removed as the party's candidate.
""If the APC now has a candidate, it will be their duty to summit it to our national headquarters so it can be included in our website ahead of the election"".
He noted that the INEC does not have the power to add or remove the name of any political party or candidate, adding that it is what is transmitted from the headquarters that is used in the state.

340,"The sun scorched that Wednesday afternoon in early January, but Hamisu seemed undisturbed. As sweat balls ran down his cheeks, his eyes poured round to see if anyone was coming to dispose wastes.
He needed to be at alert not only to get a reasonable number of empty plastics and bottles- that he would later sell- but also to get some food stuffs- that are still manageable- that have been thrown away by families that are well- to- do.
That is exactly what he been doing for the past 17 years since he left Zanfara in Nigeria&rsquo;s North West for Abuja in other to look for a means of livelihood, Hamisu told me somewhere In Mararaba- Abuja.
Hamisu had to live his parents who have been suffering with no one looking in their direction to come down to Abuja. Since then, he has been the one taking care of them and himself with the little money he makes from selling wastes.

Hamisu explaining why he joined the business
For him, the business is much better than stealing. &ldquo;Because we do not want to become armed robbers, we are forced to come out here every morning and wait for families that come around to dispose wastes. We do not like the business because it is energy sapping. But there is no option for us&rdquo; he told me in his traditional Hausa language.
Hamisu is not the only one. There are quite a number of young adults who have had to endure the heat of the sun and the almost unbearable stench of wastes just to survive.
Aliyu Salisu is 22 years. After he lost his parents- he does not recall when exactly- he became confused of what to do with his life. There was no one to help him. He even had to drop out of school because there was no money.
And so, he had to come down to Abuja from Plateau, a state in Nigeria&rsquo;s North Central after he got informed by a friend that there was something he could do to survive. He has been doing the business for the past four years now. He does not even intend to return home anymore.
But he believes that the future holds a lot in store for him.
&ldquo;I do not have anybody to return to. And so, I have decided to remain here, work hard, make money and marry a good wife that will give me children&rdquo; he said to me smiling.

341,"Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige, has assured Nigerian workers that President Muhammadu Buhari is committed to uplifting the lives of Nigerian workers and leaving behind a legacy of service and a buoyant economy.
Ngige disclosed this in a message to workers in a statement to commemorate the 2019 Workers&rsquo; Day celebration in Abuja on Tuesday.
Ngige said it was due to the president&rsquo;s resolve to better the lives of Nigerian workers that he gave states bailout to pay salary and pension of their workers.
He also said the President was determined to fashion an economy capable of creating sustainable abundance for the people.
The Theme of this year&rsquo;s celebration is &ldquo;Another 100 Years of Struggle for Jobs, Dignity and Social Justice in Nigeria&rsquo;&rsquo;.
&ldquo;It aligns with the vision and efforts of the president, to uplift the lots of the Nigerian workers and also leave a legacy of a buoyant economy for the country.&rsquo;&rsquo;
Ngige said the uniqueness of the 2019 workers celebration coincided with the centenary celebration of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which Nigeria proudly pioneered as the first Country Office in Africa, Lagos, in 1959.
He, therefore, commended the resilience of the nation&rsquo;s workforce and their numerous contributions to national development.
&ldquo;We owe plentiful accolades to the most labour-friendly president, who took practical steps to douse the restiveness in the labour force he inherited four years ago due to unpaid salaries and allowances.
&ldquo;He released bailout funds at both the state and federal level, and capped it all with a New National Minimum Wage for the Nigerian working class in public and private sectors.
&ldquo;As we move to the Next Level, I have no doubt that things will get better. I wish you all a productive and fulfilling celebration,&rdquo; he added.


"
342,"The United States Government has said it is compiling reports on the 2019 general elections in order to provide a proper response
The Assistant Secretary of State, Bureau of African Affairs, Tibor Nagy, stated this onTuesday, adding that the US was actively involved in political matters of the country, particularly regarding the 2019 elections.
According to Nagy, during the build-up to the elections, the US Ambassador, Stuart Symington, and his team took many steps to ensure that things went smoothly.
He said thatin the pre-election period, in the election period and currently in the post-election period, the US is providing phenomenal guidance to Washington on how the US Government should and should not respond to the election-related matters.
Nagy said: &ldquo;So, just rest assured that the United States of America Embassy and the Consulate in Lagos, are actively involved and are doing an absolutely superb job to monitor events and to provide guides on how Washington should react to whatever the events there are.
&ldquo;As you know, our secretary did make a telephone call.&rdquo;

The United States Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo, was reported to have placed a call across to the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, for a free, fair and credible election in the country while President Donald Trump called Buhari prior to the presidential and National Assembly elections.
The US also threatened to place a visa ban on persons involved in electoral violence.
The US Government had said: &ldquo;We, and other democratic nations, will be paying close attention to actions of individuals who interfere in the democratic process or instigate violence against the civilian population before, during, or after the elections.
&ldquo;We will not hesitate to consider consequences &ndash;including visa restrictions &ndash; for those found to be responsible for election-related violence"" the government said."
343,"On a Friday afternoon in early February, a certain man drove into the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium in the South Eastern city of Enugu on a wheelchair, visibly excited. As songs played on the stage, he danced from his own end, wishing he had legs.
Clad in a Green, White and Red party dress- that of the People&rsquo;s Democratic Party, PDP in Nigeria, he told me that he had come to join other Nigerians to express their support for the candidate of the PDP in Saturday&rsquo;s presidential election.
&ldquo;Oga, we are tired of the current administration in this country. They have not done anything for us. We have been suffering ever since they came in. So, it is time to ask them to go and enjoy what they have benefitted let us others try&rdquo;
Like him, the stadium with a capacity of 22,000 was filled as expectant Nigerians in the state waited patiently for the arrival of the candidate of the PDP and a former vice president, Atiku Abubakar and his running mate and a former governor, Peter Obi.
Soon, the candidate came in, accompanied by his campaign train, including the president of the senate, Bukola Saraki and his deputy, Ike Ekweremadu. The stadium went up in flames of excitement, with everyone raising their flags as they danced. Indeed, the man who would restructure the country, enthrone true federalism and create an enabling environment for all Nigerians to thrive has arrived.
On Saturday, February 16th, incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari, of the All Progressives Congress party, APC, and Atiku Abubakar, of the People's Democratic Party, the PDP and other candidates in the race will face the Nigerian electorate when Africa's largest democracy votes.
Since the new year, the various candidates, especially Buhari and Abubakar have been busy on the campaign trail as they approach the election finish line. They have been criss-crossing the country to attend rallies where they are attracting enormous crowds.
The 2019 presidential election- it has been widely held- will go down in history as one of the most keenly contested giving the large number of candidates vying for the country&rsquo;s no one position and the extent of competition between the two frontrunners in the race, incumbent president, Buhari and former vice- president, Abubakar.
The election has- more than ever before- witnessed an increase in the number of the younger generation who are pushing for a change with the age reduction, which became known as the Not Too Young To Run Bill.
In 2016, a coalition of young activists led a campaign for a constitutional amendment to reduce age limits for contesting elective position. Since then the likes of 35-year-old Chike Ukaegbu, a New-York based tech entrepreneur, Adamu Garba, 35, CEO of an IT company and Eunice Atuejide, a 40-year-old lawyer all joined the race.
But supporters of Buhari's key opponent, Abubakar, believe his election will be vital in reviving Nigeria's economic fortunes because of his strong business acumen.
Abubakar has been trying to become president since he was vice president and is campaigning for the fourth time in the last 22 years. Now 72, this is perhaps going to be his last chance at the top job.
Many Nigerians also believe that the scenario in 2019 seems similar with that of 2015, with growing sense that millions of Nigerians daily complain of hunger, poverty, insecurity and unemployment.
The 2015 presidential election was largely won, not only because all the 15 million Nigerians who voted for president Buhari believe in him, but because they just wanted former president Goodlick Jonathan voted out by all means.
Jonathan was both accused and loathed by many for not taking Boko Haramseriouslyand it was thought that Buhari would be better positioned to defeat the militants and bring back peace, given his years in the military.
The discontent with the Jonathan administration was widespread and in the words of former president Olusegun Obasanjo, &ldquo;anybody except Jonathan&rdquo; would do. This drove many to vote president Buhari, giving him victory in his fourth attempt at the presidency.
But four years after he assumed office, Buhari struggled to live up to the high expectations that greeted his victory in 2015. The country has beenplaguedby gangs of armed bandits preying on villagers, clashes between herdsmen and farmers and the Islamist insurgency of Boko Haram even becoming more vicious than ever.

He does not want anything other than an change of government
Now, some Nigerians who supported his election in 2015 have backtracked, campaigning for a change of guard at the presidency, even though some in the Northeast argue that there have been improvements in security in the region since 2015 while others across the core North also commend the president for his investment in Agriculture and infrastructure.
Will Nigerians, in a move reminiscent to the 2015 election, vote out another incumbent over the growing disaffection in the land? Can the widespread sentiments of growing poverty, insecurity and unemployment in the country lead to a protest vote against president Buhari?
Ezekiel Afolabi, a student at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka believes that president Buhari does not deserve a second terms because he has not done anything for the country ever since he became president in 2015, rather, he has left the situation worse than he met it.
&ldquo;Buhari thinks Nigerians are fools and so he keeps telling us he has been fighting corruption when those he is working with are highly corrupt. Where are all the money he recovered from corrupt leaders. Why is there still poverty in the land&rdquo;. He said.
He said he supports the PDP not because Atiku is a saint but because he is the only one who has got the capacity to remove the incumbent president and that he also feels that Atiku can offer to Nigeria the change it deserves and not the kind Buhari brought.
Emperor Young, a recent graduate of thesame University holds a diffent opinion. He says that a second term for the ruling APC would equal a death sentense because the government got everything wrong from their fight against corrution to their policies.
He says that just like the APC, the PDP has nothing to offer as the party is made up of thesame old heads with no workable plans on how to salvage the country. ""I will go for Kingsley Moughalu- who is also contesting- giving that he has the capacity and knowledg to be president"". he said.
On Saturday, the eyes of the entire world will yet again be on Nigeria to see if the presidential election- the sixth since return to democracy in 1999- is going to be free and fair and hold without widespread violence.
"
344,"he National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), the Nigerian professional body that regulates the activities of the electronic media has sanctioned 45 broadcast stations over alleged ethical violations during the general election.
Speaking at a news conference in Abuja on Friday, the director-general of the commission, Is&rsquo;haq Kawu, said the affected media houses were fined N500, 000 each for flouting the provisions of the Nigerian broadcasting code.
The director-general warned that any station that continues to broadcast inciting comments that threaten the security and corporate existence of the country would be shut down completely.
&ldquo;Despite our various interventions, at the end of the presidential election which was held on 23, Feb. 2019, 45 stations were found culpable of infractions on the provision of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code and have been sanction accordingly,&rdquo; Kawu said.
&ldquo;We gave them the highest level of sanction under the NBC which is to make them to pay N500,000 each and the cut across the entire country. &ldquo;NBC also sanction stations that allowed politicians to utter abusive, inciting and provocative statements during rallies.
He said the sanctioned stations cut across the country, among which are big name stations such as Channels Television, TVC, AIT and NTA.
&ldquo;There are also several radio and TV stations involved in this various infraction. &ldquo;Only recently J FM for instance in Jos, Plateau State was sanction for inciting broadcast by a preacher, who move away from religion into the arena of politics and was saying particularly inciting comments.&rdquo; He said.
He maintained that the NBC had set up a national team to monitor stations on 24 hours basis as the country moves closer to the governorship election.
"
345,"Nigeria's vice-President, Yemi Osinbajo has said President Muhammadu Buhari may be &ldquo;poorer&rdquo; now than when he was elected in 2015.
speaking at a dinner in honour of volunteer supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC), at the presidential villa, Abuja,Osinbajo recalledhow he saw Buhari&rsquo;s assets declaration form in 2015.
He said &ldquo;When I looked at his assets declaration form, I was checking it in 2015, I said to him, &lsquo;Mr President, I am so much richer than you, it is an embarrassment&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said to which Buhari responded:&ldquo;I am only a soldier, you are a big lawyer, so you should have more money than me.&rdquo;
continuing, he said &ldquo;I can tell you that he is perhaps even poorer than he was in 2015 when I saw his declaration of assets form,&rdquo; Osinbajo added.
He also also used the occasion to solicit votes for the APC in the supplementary elections scheduled for March 23, 2019. &ldquo;We are still not done with the elections. On the 23rd of March, we still have some outstanding states and as you know we are re-running in about six states,&rdquo; said Osinbajo.
&ldquo;And all of the efforts we need to put into those six states, we still need to do. We can&rsquo;t afford to slack off and say the job is done; we still have some things to do.&rdquo; He added."
346,"The Presidency yesterday restated that nobody could question the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration as they are visible for all to see.
It noted that Nigerians had voted him for second term because of his sincere commitment to combating terrorism, restructure the economy and create jobs as well as fight corruption.
In a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, the Presidency said the People&rsquo;s Democratic Party (PDP), who chose to demonise and denigrate Buhari in their campaigns, must have realised that demonisation and denigration of an individual do not bring in poll dividends.
According to him, from the commencement of the campaign, President Buhari had a two-pronged election strategy, which were to showcase the achievements of his administration in its first term and to cash in on his popularity with the lower rungs of the population.
He said: &ldquo;This is an administration that has been investing in people.
&ldquo;Reforms are being carried out in the justice sector with a number of domestic legislations and international agreements to facilitate the identification, tracing, freezing, recovery and forfeiture of ill-gotten assets.
&ldquo;The administration&rsquo;s primary sectors of agriculture and solid minerals have experienced growth of 180 and 565 percentage points respectively. Nigeria has today achieved near self-sufficiency in rice production.&rdquo;
He also reiterated that the administration had demonstrated a single-minded commitment to upgrading and developing Nigeria&rsquo;s transport, power and health infrastructure.
&ldquo;Road projects are ongoing across every state of the country, with many of these projects having been abandoned for many years.
&ldquo;The country&rsquo;s narrow-gauge rail network of 3,500 kilometres is currently being upgraded; Abuja&rsquo;s light rail system has been completed and commissioned,&rdquo; the statement further said.

347,"During a closed-door meeting with Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz last week, Xi Jinping was asked what he thought the chances were for a successful conclusion of this week&rsquo;s China-US trade talks in Washington. &ldquo;Fifty-fifty,&rdquo; the Chinese president replied, according to three people briefed on the discussion.
Those odds changed dramatically on Monday morning after Mr Xi was greeted by tweets from US president Donald Trump threatening to raise tariffs on Chinese exports to the US as early as Friday.
The move enraged officials in Beijing. As of mid-afternoon on Monday, it appeared likely that Mr Xi&rsquo;s lead trade negotiator would at least choose to delay his planned trip to Washington this week for a &ldquo;final round&rdquo; of trade talks that both sides had strongly hinted would result in a draft agreement.
One Chinese government policy adviser told the Financial Times that executives at large state-owned enterprises who had planned to join vice-premier Liu He&rsquo;s delegation were hastily rearranging their travel plans.
Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were expected to play a central role in any agreement to end the trade war between the world&rsquo;s two largest economies, because they would be the principal buyers of US agricultural and energy exports. Another person briefed on the negotiations said Chinese officials were still standing by for a shorter trip, with a much smaller delegation, later this week.
&ldquo;Everything is up for grabs,&rdquo; the person said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s hard to believe they would leave if Trump is imposing new tariffs on Friday. That&rsquo;s a big gamble for Xi.&rdquo; While Mr Xi&rsquo;s administration is happy to agree to large SOE purchases of US commodities aimed at reducing the two countries&rsquo; trade imbalance, Mr Trump suggested that Chinese negotiators were backtracking on other understandings related to Beijing&rsquo;s industrial policies.
These included protection of US commercial secrets and &ldquo;enforcement mechanisms&rdquo; if either side felt the other had breached the terms of the agreement. &ldquo;The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!&rdquo; Mr Trump said in a tweet.
 Robert Lighthizer, US trade representative, wants to roll back existing tariffs, which affect about half of all Chinese exports to the US, in phases. Mr Liu has argued for both sides to immediately repeal punitive tariffs imposed by their countries since the trade war erupted last summer.
Wang Yong, an international trade expert at Peking University, said such haggling was not surprising as the two sides raced to finalise an agreement. &ldquo;The Chinese side has begun to review the agreement internally, which has led the Chinese side to renegotiate some aspects,&rdquo; said Prof Wang. &ldquo;The biggest difference between the two sides is Trump&rsquo;s insistence on retaining some tariffs.
From a domestic political perspective, this is very difficult for China to accept.&rdquo; Chinese officials and advisers are also confident that better than expected economic growth in the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy, combined with Mr Xi&rsquo;s intolerance of all forms of dissent, will strengthen Beijing&rsquo;s hand while Mr Trump will have to contend with a political backlash at home.
&ldquo;Pressure in the US markets will appear soon,&rdquo; said Prof Wang. &ldquo;China is in a better negotiating position, so there is no need to rush. If they don&rsquo;t want this agreement now, the US will lose more than China will.&rdquo;
Arthur Kroeber at Gavekal Research said: &ldquo;It was always unrealistic to think that China would throw overboard its entire development model in order to secure a quick truce with the US.&rdquo; He added that Mr Trump now faced a choice of having to &ldquo;deliver his tariff increase&rdquo;, which would almost certainly make markets tank, &ldquo;or finding a face-saving way to claim that his threat forced some Chinese movement&rdquo;.
Recommended US-China trade dispute Timeline: the long road to a US-China trade deal Over recent weeks, US farmers, financial markets and commercial groups have been looking forward to a resolution of the two countries&rsquo; year-long trade war, encouraged by optimistic statements about the talks from Mr Trump, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser.
&ldquo;The existing tariffs are damaging to American companies and consumers, and additional tariffs will compound those damages,&rdquo; said Jake Parker, head of the US-China Business Council&rsquo;s Beijing office. &ldquo;Both sides need to use this week to make progress on the negotiations rather than returning us to tariff battles.&rdquo;
James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based partner at law firm Perkins Coie and former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said Mr Trump&rsquo;s surprise threats betrayed the US president&rsquo;s &ldquo;total misunderstanding on how to negotiate with the Chinese&rdquo;. Last September, Mr Liu cancelled plans to travel to Washington for a critical negotiating round after Mr Trump followed through on a similar threat.
Members of the vice-premier&rsquo;s negotiating team have also said repeatedly that they will never negotiate &ldquo;with a knife at our throat&rdquo;."
348,"Ahead of the Governorship and State Assembly elections, youth organizations and students' leaders in Enugu state, South Eastern Nigeria, Wednesday endorsed the incumbent governor of the State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi.
Speaking during a joint press conference of youth and students leaders in Enugu, the state chairman of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, NYCN, Paschal Ugwu said that the decision to endorse the governor for a second term was informed by the fact that he has performed creditably well in the last four years, especially in terms of youth inclusiveness in governance.

349,"Ndi Imo in diaspora organization have congratulated president Muhammadu Buhari on his emergence as the president of the country in last week&rsquo;s Presidential election that pitted him against candidate of the People&rsquo;s Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar.
In a statement released by the organization through its President General, Joy Opara, the organization also congratulated Rochas Okorocha on his victory as senator.
According to Opara, the landslide victory of president Buhari and Okorocha during the polls clearly indicates that the electorates trust in their ability to deliver to them the dividends of democracy.
While appealing to the INEC to ensure that the rights of all voters in Imo State and the entire country is well respected and protected, Opara called on electorates to go out and vote peacefully during the forth coming Governorship and State Assembly Elections,
&ldquo;Taking note of inadequate awareness on peaceful election in the state, we therefore call on political parties, contestants, and the State authority to create more awareness and provision of adequate security before, during and after the election In order to do away with election violence&rdquo;
She said that politicians must do well not to incite violence that will disrupt the peace and development of the state and indeed the entire country during the governorship and state Assembly elections.
&ldquo;We deeply appreciate the Domestic and Foreign Election Observers in Imo State for their contributions towards our democracy&rdquo; she said.
Speaking further, she said &ldquo;as we all strive to preempt, promote, project and protect the good image of our dear state and country, ""we are of optimistic that Imo State and Nigeria are getting better under our advocacy watch""

350,"A former Deputy National Publicuty Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, has commended a report released by a U.S.-based firm, Atlantic Council&rsquo;s Digital Forensic Research Lab, for &ldquo;exposing an Isreali-based political consulting and lobbying firm named Archimedes&rdquo;, for allegedly coordinating false reports on social media against former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.
Facebook had on Thursday banned Archimedesfrom the platform over its &ldquo;coordinated and deceptive behavior&rdquo; as well as conducted a sweeping takedown of dozens of accounts and hundreds of pages primarily aimed at disrupting elections in African countries, with some scattered activity in Southeast Asia and Latin America.
Reacting to the development through a statement on Saturday, Frank said that the world will gradually know all the evil secret behind the declaration of Gen. Muhammadu Buhari as the winner of the last presidential election.
According to Frank, one of the pages that Facebook deleted on Thursday was filled with viral misinformation and direct attacks on Abubakar, the former vice president of Nigeria. The page&rsquo;s banner image showed Abubakar as Darth Vader, the Star Wars villain, holding up a sign reading, &ldquo;Make Nigeria Worse Again.&rdquo;
He also quoted the AP&rsquo;s report &ldquo;that on the overall, the misleading accounts had reached some 2.8 million users, and the pages had engaged over 5,000 followers, according to Facebook&rsquo;s estimates.&rdquo;
While thanking Facebook for bringing down the fake accounts, Frank said that &ldquo;Nigerians ought to be worried about how the APC-led government is spending huge amount of money just to discredit the rightful winner of the 2019 presidential election, Atiku Abubakar.
&ldquo;I believe that if a lie goes on for 20 years, truth will definitely catchup with it one day. It will not be long before Nigerians will realise how desperate and fake President Muhammadu Buhari is in his bid to hang onto power.&rdquo;
The political activist called on the international community to note the Associated Press&rsquo; report and the extent of damage done to the main opposition party in Nigeria and its Presidential candidate during the last general election.
&ldquo;The AP&rsquo;s report has clearly shown the level of lies sponsored against Atiku during and after the last general election. The campaign of calumny has not stopped but Nigerians should henceforth disregard malicious reports in the social media against the former VP,&rdquo; Frank stated."
351,"
ABUJA, Nigeria &ndash; They had come down from surrounding hills as they always did, wielding guns, machetes, and cutlasses and swept through 11 villages, sparing no one, killing women and children. At the end of the killing spree, scores of people were down.
Those were the words that Muhammadu Abubakar told me on a couch in Nigeria&rsquo;s Federal Capital, a cigarette sandwiched between two of his right fingers.
Abubakar clearly recalls how he lost five members of his household when marauding herdsmen besieged several communities in one of their fierce attacks in Nigeria&rsquo;s North Central State of Plateau in 2018,killing about 86 people.
&ldquo;It was on the early hours of the day,&rdquo; Abubakar continues. &ldquo;We were just waking up but still tired having worked for hours on our farm the previous day when we heard deafening gunshots and people scampering for safety.&rdquo;
When Abubakar and members of his family came out to see what was happening, they saw flames building castles in the air. Surrounding communities had been thrown into confusion. While some of his family members escaped the attack, 5 lost their lives.
After theattackson 11 communities, Abubakar, whose family was only struggling to survive at that time, traveled down to Abuja where he has been searching for the means of livelihood. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I will ever forget that attack,&rdquo; he said, anger and pain running over his face.
Hopes dashed
Abubakar&rsquo;s story is no different from that of thousands of Nigerians who have lost loved ones due to years of insecurity, but he is also part of the Nigerian population who elected President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, with the hope that he will turn the tables around and address the security challenges facing the country.
In 2015, Buhari won the presidential election, beating former President Jonathan by 2.5 million votes to become the first opposition candidate to win a presidential election in Nigeria.
Nigeria has beenfightinga war against Boko Haram since 2009. The terrorist sect intends to establish a hardline Islamic caliphate in Northeast Nigeria. Since its inception, the deadly sect has killed more than 50,000 people and has displaced millions as well as destroyed much property.
But in the build-up to the election, Buhari promised security for Nigeria. HetoldAl Jazeera in a February 2015 interview that if he were to come to power, he would work to &ldquo;pressure Boko Haram out of Nigeria,&rdquo; adding in his first speech as president-elect that &ldquo;In tackling the insurgency, we have a tough and urgent job to do.&rdquo;
His victory at the polls was apparently hinged on his promise to tackle insecurity which had become a major challenge for the country and in particular, insurgent activities which have almost crippled many sectors.

Muhammadu Abubakar explained how he lost five family members to marauding herdsmen.

Former President Goodluck Jonathan was both accused and loathed by many for not taking Boko Haramseriouslyand it was thought that Buhari would be better positioned to defeat the militants and bring back peace, given his years in the military.
But four years after he assumed office, Buhari has struggled to live up to the high expectations that greeted his victory in 2015. The country has beenplaguedby gangs of armed bandits preying on villagers, clashes between herdsmen and farmers and the Islamist insurgency of Boko Haram even becoming more vicious than ever.
Even though he hasrepeatedlysaid that the Boko Haram jihadist group has been defeated, analysis of its attacks shows that the group killed more than 900 people in just 2017, marginally more than it did in 2016,consistentlymounted attacks during the year, defying Mr. Buhari&rsquo;s assertion that the militants had been routed.
Thousands have lost their lives since 2015 and the country still has well over 1.8 million internally displaced persons in camps spread all over.
About1,700 violent deathshave been attributed to Fulani herdsmen in attacks carried out between January and September 2018, according to a report by the 2018 Global Terrorism Index. The struggle for economic resources like land and water between farmers and cattle herders has led to bloodbaths, with thousands losing their lives to the age-long clash.
In 2017,clashesbetween nomadic herdsmen and local farmers resulted in at least549 deathsand thousands displaced across Benue, Taraba, Zamfara, Kaduna, Plateau, Nasarawa, Niger and Plateau states, with Benue, Plateau, Kaduna, and Taraba being hotbeds of such attacks.
Reacting to the orgy of attacks by suspected herdsmen, the country&rsquo;s director of Amnesty Internationalsaidthat countless numbers of people have lost their lives, yet the government is still not doing enough to protect communities from these violent clashes. Worse, the killers are getting away with murder.
In 2018 alone, in the state of Zamfara,hundredsdied in mass murders and more than 21,000 people have been forced from their homes. There has also been an increased rate of killings and kidnappings in the country.
In October 2018, Former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Sabundu, was shot dead by unknown gunmen along Keffi-Bade road, Nasarawa state, while returning from his farm.
The assassination of the four-star general occurred three months after the body of General Idris Alikakli, the immediate past Chief of Administration, Army Headquarters, Abuja, wasdiscoveredsomewhere in Lafande community, Jos South LGA of Plateau state. He was reportedly killed and buried in a shallow grave by irate youths. The death of these two officers left the entire nation in shock as it lends a loud voice to the height of insecurity in the country.
In a statement, Chidi Odinkalu, a human rights activist based in Abuja,saidthat there has been a significant collapse of security in Nigeria. He added that killings by bandits and other miscreants only happen because of &ldquo;government failings.&rdquo; &ldquo;Banditry occurs in ungoverned territory.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is in these rural areas with little or no cover. The territory is completely exposed, so at the heart of the issue is a crisis of governance,&rdquo; he added.
The future of a generation threatened
Years of combined attacks by Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and heightened herdsmen attacks in the North Central states have led to an entire generation of children being deprived of an education.
A Demographic Health Survey (DHS)conductedby the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and the Nigerian government shows that the population of out of school children in Nigeria has alarmingly risen from 10.5 million to 13.2 million which means that the country ranks highest among countries with out of school children in the world. And this means that the country islosing outon a literate and skilled workforce which it needs to grow economically,
Hussaini Abdu, the director at Plan International in Nigeria, an independent development and humanitarian organization which has beenworkingin Borno and Adamawa states to support children who left school due to insurgency to recommence their studies by providing school materials and training teachers believes that without education, these children are at risk of being seen as an ideal recruitment tool for extremist organizations or criminal gangs.
The military itself has had a not-so-easy campaign against the insurgents as they have been increasingly stretched, recording a huge number of casualties recently. On Nov 18, there was a report of how Boko Haram insurgents attacked a military base in Melete, Borno State, killing over 100 soldiers. Prior to the attack and even after the attack, the insurgents attacked several military bases in the North.
With the deepening ferocity of the insurgents and the ever-increasing casualties of the war, Nigerians will not forget the promises Buhari made to them during the election. As they prepare to go to the polls in February, they expect a change, not the same as what they are experiencing now, but something way better.

352,"Ahead of the 2019 general elections in Nigeria, a lot of claims and counter claims have continued to arise, especially between the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC and the main Opposition, the People&rsquo;s Democratic Party, PDP.
The national chairman of the PDP, the main opposition of the APC in next Saturday&rsquo;s Presidential Polls, Uche for instance has alleged that more than one million persons on the national voter register are dead.
The chairman said this on Tuesday at an emergency meeting of the leaders of PDP in Abuja. He said the PDP has evidence that &ldquo;over 1,050,051 dead voters will vote in this election.&rdquo;
According to him, &ldquo;the voter register contains the data of dead voters. Permanent voters cards for dead voters were printed and distributed nationwide. The idea of ghost voters is consistent with the nature of this virtual President.&rdquo;
He also stated that the INEC, Nigeria&rsquo;s election umpire is plotting hard to manipulate the outcome of Saturday&rsquo;s presidential election, having shifted it by one week which generated a lot of controversy.
In his words &ldquo;coordinated approach&rdquo; to register foreigners as voters, mainly from Niger and Cameroon. &ldquo;That is why INEC has established so many polling Units along the border with Cameroon and Niger,&rdquo; he said.
Speaking further, he said that following the successful campaign of the PDP, it can be guarantee that &ldquo;Nigerians have resolved to return PDP to power in 2019 after APC&rsquo;s four years of plunging the country deeper into poverty.
&ldquo;Overwhelmed by this reality, the ruling APC decided to sabotage the electoral body that had earlier played into their hands by allowing the cabals and other APC hawks to hijack the activities of the commission as contractors and consultants, he said.
This is not the first time the PDP is alleging foul play in the electoral process.
As at when this report was filed, INEC director of voter education and publicity, Festus Okoye is yet to respond to a text message sent for his reaction to the allegations.

353,"On a Saturday in late November, 76 year old Simeon Omeje, sat in front of his house nestled somewhere at the backwoods of Alor Uno rolling hills located somewhere in the South Eastern state of Enugu. Intermittently, he looked in the direction where the two rooms he had built for himself and his children lay in ruins.
&ldquo;My son, he begins as he tried to recall what exactly happened to his house. &ldquo;It was in July at 12 am I and my wife had gone into our own room after a busy day when the clouds were gathering by 8 pm.
Omeje now occupies only a single room with his wife and children. He tells me, his face forlorn, that he was fast asleep when the rain began. At exactly 12 am- when the rain had become intense, he heard a reverberating sound and when he came out to see what was happening, he discovered that the two rooms had been completely brought down by the rain. His whole compound was flooded.

A section of Omeje's house that was destroyed by erosion
&ldquo;At first, I did not know what to do. But when I saw that the rain was gradually finding its way into our own room, I quickly rushed in and took my wife and our little daughter out and carried them to a place where they slept till the next morning&rsquo;. He said, his hands wrapped around his chest.
By the time Simeon came back in the morning, his room had been filled with water. His property had been taken away. At one end of his house, Simeon reared some livestock. But none of them was spared.
He recalls that sometime in 2016, he also lost a part of his house to the erosion and was still trying to see if he can put that one together when the rain came again and destroyed the remaining two rooms.
Omeje, alongside other inhabitants in his community have suffered a major problem of erosion which usually affects them each time there is heavy downpour. The problem is believed to have existed for a period of 32 years and even more.
This problem, which has become a major source of worry to the people, has claimed several lives. Yet, nothing has been done. For families like Omeje&rsquo;s, there is no option than to keep waiting for the government to take necessary steps as there is no money to go elsewhere.

354,"Ahead of the presidential and parliamentary elections which were shifted by a week and now hold today, fears of possible outbreak of violence have gripped many Nigerians and may likely scare some of them away from the elections.
Since the new year, they presidential aspirants, particularly Buhari and Abubakar were busy on the campaign trail as they approached the electionfinish line. They have all criss-crossed the country to attend rallies where they attracted enormous crowds.
During these campaigns, several deaths occurred. Apart from clashes between supporters of the ruling APC and their arch rivals in the PDP, other pockets of violence, including the killing of over 60 people during attacks on two communities in Nigeria&rsquo;s Northwestern Kaduna state, have been reported from various places in Nigeria.
There have also been reports of the killing of APC officials in Benue, Rivers and Imo states. All of these have sent ripples down the spines of Africa&rsquo;s largest democracy as they prepare to vote.
Buhari shoot - aside- order
On Monday, Buhari gave what can be best described as a military order when he asked the military and the police to deal ruthlessly with ballot box snatchers during the elections.
While speaking at a national caucus meeting of the APC, he said that miscreants who attempt to disrupt Saturday&rsquo;s presidential and National Assembly elections would do so at the expense of their lives
He said &ldquo;I am going to warn anybody who thinks he has enough influence in his locality to lead a body of thugs, snatch ballot boxes or to disturb the voting system that he will do it at the expense of his own life.
Reaction trail the president&rsquo;s order
After giving orders to the military, many Nigerians, including civil societies and supporters of the main opposition party have continued to pour scathing criticisms on the president, with some describing it as undemocratic and others saying it is intended to scare voters away from the polling units so the ruling APC can manipulate the polls.
The National Chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus said that president Buhari gave marching orders to the military and the police to help leaders of the APC oppress Nigerian voters in his alleged desperation to cling on to power
At a press briefing organized by the Young Friends of Atiku, (YFOA), on Wednesday in Enugu, Eastern Nigeria, the pro-Atiku group condemned the presidential order insisting that the President should have signed the amended sections of the Electoral Act to avoid all forms of thuggery instead of issuing death threats to Nigerians.
Describing the decision as uncivilized and unprecedented, the Director General of the group, Silas Onu said that the order given by the president is one that has no objective mode of application or enforcement, thereby leaving the army with a subjective discretion of determining what to describe as an act of box snatching.
The Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP asked Nigerians and the International Community to hold the president responsible for any loss of lives during the elections.
It said that the President was unambiguous in his call that citizens should be shot dead extra judicially if they ever tried to snatch ballot boxes during the elections and that it was the most callous public statement ever made by a Nigerian President.
PAN Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF also described president Buhari&rsquo;s directives to the army as a call for jungle justice. The group said that the directive was quite unfortunate, condemnable and unacceptable as it is capable of being manipulated against innocent voters by overzealous political opponents.
Army cannot disobey the president&rsquo;s order
At an emergency meeting of the PDP leadership which held after Buhari&rsquo;s order, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar advised the Army not to obey what he describe as unlawful orders.
His party asked the Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai to instead concentrate on his very demanding assignment of protecting the territorial integrity of the nation and ending insurgency rather than dabbling into partisan politics at the risk of national cohesion.
In his response, Buratai demanded that the PDP presidential candidate withdrew his advice which he said was tantamount to incitement.
&ldquo;It is unfortunate to hear persons who are aspiring to rule this country again inciting the army to disobedience,&rdquo; the army chief said, adding that &ldquo;direct and public incitement of the Nigerian Military against democracy and constituted civil authority will not be tolerated&rdquo;.
He reiterated that one of the core values of the army was loyalty to constituted authority and that must be 100 per cent, warning that officers who are not given to loyalty must resign before the election.
INEC differs with order
In its response to the president&rsquo;s order, the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu said, at a press conference in Abuja on Tuesday that the commission would stand by the Electoral Act which states that persons who snatch election materials are liable to a prison term of two years or maximum fine of 500,000&rdquo;.
Reacting to the president&rsquo;s comment, Yakubu maintained that the position of the commission is that all violators of the Electoral Act should be punished according to the provisions of the Act.
President re- assures Nigerians of their security 
In a televised nationwide broadcast in Abuja on the eve of the rescheduled election, Buhari charged electorates not to be &ldquo;afraid of rumors of violence and unrest.
The president asked electorates not to allow anyone discourage them from exercising their rights as citizens and voters saying that the nation&rsquo;s security agencies would ensure that adequate security measures were in place.
He emphasized that his administration had put in place adequate security measures that would enable the electorate to vote in an atmosphere of openness and peace, devoid of fear from threat or intimidation.
&ldquo;As citizens, there is no greater duty than this and no greater honour. Tomorrow, I know you will once again make Nigeria proud of its people. &ldquo;Our security agencies have worked diligently to ensure that adequate security measures are in place&rdquo;, he said during the broadcast.
Nnamdi Obasi, a senior Nigeria researcher with International Crisis Group's told Aljazeera that &ldquo;the intensely acrimonious exchanges between the two major political parties have already resulted in many clashes, risking further violence during and after the polls.
""Nigerian elections have often been characterized by violence and with political tensions now further aggravated by current conflicts and deepening insecurity, there are fears that this election would be no different from the ones in the past,"" he said.
The president has made efforts- through his speech- to reassure the people of their safety during the polls. But one thing remains- that the electorates go to the polls with every sense of trepidation.

"
355,"The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has reacted to remarks by the US Government, expressing disappointment with the conduct of the 2019 general elections.
The Chief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, while reacting to the US Government statement, appreciated the US support for the nation&rsquo;s electoral process, but was quick to add that no country in the world could conduct a perfect election.
Oyekanmi also insisted that the US observations were not enough to discredit the integrity of the elections.
He said: &ldquo;As one of our important partners, the Independent National Electoral Commission appreciates the United States&rsquo; interest and support for Nigeria&rsquo;s electoral process.
&ldquo;However, there is no country in the world where general elections are perfect from the beginning to the end. In our reckoning, coupled with various reports released by local and international observers so far, the 2019 general elections were a success, but by no means perfect.
&ldquo;There are lessons to be learnt and there is room for improvement. The commission will contiynue to do its best to deliver credible elections with the hope that the major players will appreciate the importance of playing by the rules and ultimately accept that no political office is worth the precious life of any human being. All is vanity.&rdquo;"
356,"
President Donald Trump on Thursday overturned longstanding US policy regarding the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, announcing that ""it is time"" for the US to ""fully recognize Israel's Sovereignty"" over the region.

""After 52 years it is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel's Sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which is of critical strategic and security importance to the State of Israel and Regional Stability,"" Trump tweeted.

The announcement hands Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a significant foreign policy victory, less than three weeks before Israelis head to the polls to decide whether he should remain in power.

The move comes just days before Netanyahu is set to join Trump at the White House and follows weeks during which Netanyahu has renewed his push for the US to recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel.


Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the Six-Day War of 1967 and formally annexed the territory in 1981. But that annexation has not been recognized by the international community, which has regarded the Golan Heights as occupied territory and Israeli settlements there as illegal under international law.

The UN special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, recently reiterated that position.

""The Security Council is very clear that the Golan is Syrian territory, and the first aspect of (Resolution) 2254 is of course the territorial integrity of Syria,"" he said in a news briefing in late February.


Netanyahu quickly took to Twitter to thank Trump, tweeting: ""At a time when Iran seeks to use Syria as a platform to destroy Israel, President Trump boldly recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Thank you President Trump! @realDonaldTrump.""

In a short phone call between the two leaders, Netanyahu told Trump, ""You made history,"" according to a readout of the call provided by the Prime Minister's Office.

It was not clear if the White House would release additional information or specifics about the move to recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel beyond Trump's tweet.

Former US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who served under President Barack Obama, said the move ""raises a lot of concern"" and said it is difficult to not see this as an attempt to buttress Netanyahu's chances of remaining prime minister.

""It's hard not to put two and two together,"" Panetta said, adding that ""The President has made clear his support for Netanyahu.""

Ahead of Saturday's Presidential Election, a pro-Atiku Support Group,Young Friends of Atiku, (YFOA), on Wednesday in Enugu, South Eastern Nigeria, condemned in strong terms the presidential order asking those intending to snatch ballot box to stay clear of the polling booths or pay with their lives.

The group insisted that if President Muhammadu Buhari hadsigned the amended sections of the Electoral Act, all forms of thuggery in the up coming general elections would have been eliminated.

Addressing newsmen, the Director General of the group, Silas Onu said that the order given by the president is one that has no objective mode of application or enforcement, thereby leaving the army with a subjective discretion of determining what to describe as an act of box snatching.He regretted that the army will simply use the order to muscle the agents of opposition parties into silence and cowardice for the fear of being killed by the state agents.""Seeing that the opposition parties have remained resolute to act in accordance to law at all times, the president has now resorted I to terrorizing his own citizens with state violence on election day"" he said.While condemning all acts of violence, including electoral violence, Onu stated that recent history clearly shows that ballot box snatching is no longer the main threat to a credible election in Nigeria as vote buying has since supplanted thuggery.Describing the decision as uncivilized and unprecedented, he said that those involved in electoral malpractice should only be apprehended and prosecuted in accordance with appropriate laws and not killed as ordered by the president.""We had expected that if President Buhari truly intends to stem the tides of such misconduct during election, he will simply call on the security to be 100% neutral and also ensure that all electoral offenders are arrested and prosecuted in accordance with our existing laws""""If the state agents are so determined to serve an individual president at the expense of the nation, then, they must be ready to kill as many Nigerians as possible to keep Buhari in office. But Nigerians have resolved to sack Buhari and no amount of death threats can deter us because the live of every Nigerian citizen is as important as that of the president"". He said.The group also condemned in strong terms the alleged plans to postpone elections in Borno, Adamawa and Kaduna in a bid to give the ruling APC enough time to carry out its alleged rigging plan whenever elections are held in those three states."
358,"After the presentation of its ad hoc committee, the Nigerian Senate on Tuesday approved N30,000 as the new minimum wage for workers.
The committee&rsquo;s report, presented by Senator Francis Alimikhena was approved after the National Minimum Wage Act CAP N61 LFN (repeal and re-enactment) Bill, 2019 after surviving the three readings.
Upon the presentation and the approval of the report, the committee was afterwards dissolved.
Reacting to the report of the committee, senate leader, Senator Ahmed Lawal said the government needed not wait till it was threatened by strike action before the needful was done.
He said, &ldquo;The Ad-hoc Committee promised to give a new minimum wage to Nigerians and they have fulfilled the promise. This gesture should be appreciated. We do not have to wait until we are threatened with strike action before we take action. The Nigerian workers must show that the government is paying them and they are paying the government in service
The Senate president, Bukola Saraki acknowledged the resilience of Nigerian workers.
He said, &ldquo;I want to commend the leaders of the organisations of the union. Let me also state that as government, we should ensure that at times like these, we should not wait for there to be strikes to do what is truly deserving for our workers.
&ldquo;Let me join our colleagues to commend the efforts of the committee. More importantly, let me commend the patience of Nigerian workers and the leadership of the Labour Union, who have over the years been calling for this minimum wage and have carried their efforts responsibly,&rsquo;&rsquo; he added."

The News Agency of Nigeria, NAN reports that the market capitalisation for last trading day in February shed N196 billion despite the N16 dividend declared by Dangote Cement.
Specifically, the market capitalisation shed N196 billion or 1.63 per cent to close at N11.828 trillion compared with N12.024 trillion achieved on Wednesday.
In the same vein, the All Share Index lost 525.54 points to close at 31,728.70 when compared with 32,244.24 recorded on Wednesday.
Ambrose Omordion, a market analyst,attributed the development to investors disappointment over the outcome of the elections.
Omordion told NAN that smart investors that took a position earlier in the market ahead of the presidential election and earnings seasons were disappointed.
He said that apart from the outcome of the elections, everything was against the stock market ranging from delayed budget, expiration of the tenure of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor by June.
&ldquo;The only factor for the stock market now is this earnings season, because nothing will happen between now and May 29,&rdquo; Omordion said.
Omordion said that the trend might likely continue unless there was a change in economic policies and reforms by the president.
He, however, called on investors to target pension funds stocks that were consistent in dividend payment in the last four years.

360,"Expectedly, the candidate of the People&rsquo;s Democratic Party, PDP, in the just concluded election, Atiku Abubakar, has rejected the election results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), insisting that the whole process was &ldquo;heavily militarized&rdquo; and results manipulated.
He was defeated by incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari with over three million votes. But in a statement issued by him on Wednesday morning, the one-time vice-president said he will be challenging the election in court.
According to him, &ldquo;If I had lost in a free and fair election, I would have called the victor within seconds of my being aware of his victory to offer not just my congratulations, but my services to help unite Nigeria by being a bridge between the North and the South.
He said &ldquo;in my democratic struggles for the past three decades, I have never seen our democracy so debased as it was on Saturday, February 23, 2019. 2007 was a challenge, but President Yar&rsquo;Adua was remorseful. In 2019, it is sad to see those who trampled on democracy thumping their noses down on the Nigerian people. &ldquo;Consequently, I hereby reject the result of the February 23, 2019 sham election and will be challenging it in court.&rdquo;
Below is his full statement with the title ""Democracy Will Not Be Emasculated in Nigeria""
I thank the Nigerian people who trooped out in their millions to perform their civic duty this past Saturday. The patriotism of Nigerians is heartwarming and affirms my oft-repeated statement that we are brothers and sisters born from the womb of one mother Nigeria.
With regards to the Presidential elections that took place on February 23, 2019, it is clear that there were manifest and premeditated malpractices in many states which negate the results announced.
One obvious red flag is the statistical impossibility of states ravaged by the war on terror generating much higher voter turnouts than peaceful states. The suppressed votes in my strongholds are so apparent and amateurish, that I am ashamed as a Nigerian that such could be allowed to happen. How can total votes in Akwa-Ibom, for instance, be 50% less than what they were in 2015?
Another glaring anomaly is the disruption of voting in strongholds of the Peoples Democratic Party in Lagos, Akwa-Ibom, Rivers and diverse other states, with the authorities doing little or nothing and in some cases facilitating these unfortunate situations. (See attached links to documentary evidences).
The militarization of the electoral process is a disservice to our democracy and a throwback to the jackboot era of military dictatorship. In some areas of the country, such as, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Imo states, troops deployed for the elections turned their guns on the very citizens they were meant to protect. This is condemnable and should not be associated with our electoral process in the future.
I am a democrat and there are democratic avenues available to present the truth to the nation and the watching world. Already, many international observers have given their verdicts, which corroborate our observations. I am sure more will come in the coming hours and days.
If I had lost in a free and fair election, I would have called the victor within seconds of my being aware of his victory to offer not just my congratulations, but my services to help unite Nigeria by being a bridge between the North and the South.
However, in my democratic struggles for the past three decades, I have never seen our democracy so debased as it was on Saturday, February 23, 2019. 2007 was a challenge, but President Yar&rsquo;Adua was remorseful. In 2019, it is sad to see those who trampled on democracy thumping their noses down on the Nigerian people.
Consequently, I hereby reject the result of the February 23, 2019 sham election and will be challenging it in court. I want to assure my supporters and the entire Nigerian people that together, we will not allow democracy to be emasculated.
I hope and pray Nigerians will someday summon the courage to defend democracy. That is the only way we can move away from being the world headquarters for extreme poverty.

361,"President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to Saturday&rsquo;s gunmen attack on Nandu Gbok community in Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State which left at least nine persons dead.
While condemning the attack in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the president decried the level of damage done by politics to the lives and properties of Nigerians across the country.
According to him&ldquo;If the people resist government&rsquo;s efforts to hold the perpetrators and their sponsors accountable, it would be very difficult to bring the violence to a permanent end.&rdquo;
He said that &ldquo;Everything is politicised in Nigeria, including the efforts to bring offenders to justice, because their people will rise up in arms to resist their arrests and prosecution.&rdquo;
The gunmen had invaded Nandu Gbok community in the early hours of Saturday, shooting sporadically and burning down about 30 houses in the process.
Reacting to the incidence, Buhari urged those behind the violence in Kaduna to come to terms with the fact that mutual violence has no winners, but losers on both sides of the conflict.
He said, &ldquo;I am deeply troubled by the fact that sanctity of life is now treated with such reckless disregard that people derive joy in shedding the blood of others or perceived enemies.
He regretted that &ldquo;Inhumanity has replaced compassion in the hearts and minds of the perpetrators of these atrocities. No responsible leader would go to bed happy to see his citizens savagely killing one another on account of ethnic and religious bigotry.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Violence cannot be the solution to these persistent conflicts as long as people resort to deliberate provocations, revenge and counter revenge,&rdquo; President Buhari added.
He stated that they communities involved must put their shoulder to the wheel in order to find a lasting solution to the crisis as government remains committed to protecting its citizens.
The president insisted that lack of cooperation by those involved might frustrate the government&rsquo;s efforts towards finding a lasting solution, especially if those efforts were politicised.
He described hate, bigotry and prejudice as &ldquo;deadly poisons that have infected the human psyche on such scale that people now don&rsquo;t have any moral inhibitions about taking life.&rdquo;
President Buhari also appealed to the warring communities to stop frustrating efforts of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to deliver food, medicines, and temporary shelter to the victims of the violence in urgent need of assistance."
362,"The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC in the early hours of Saturday, February, 16th announced the postponement of the presidential and National Assembly after four years of extensive preparations.
That means Nigeria will not be deciding its next president today Feb. 16 as previously planned.
The body explained that it took the decision following a careful review of the implementation and operational plan and the determination to conduct free, fair and credible elections. Reports suggest that the elections could not possibly have progressed as scheduledgiven anticipated shortagesof voting materials, especially ballot papers, in some states. The presidential and national assembly elections will now be held a week later on Saturday Feb. 23 while that of state governors will now hold on the 9th of March.
INEC announced the decision at 2.30am local time on Saturdayafter a late night emergency meeting with just hours polls due to open on Saturday.
INEC chairmanMahmood Yakubu speaking at the early morning press conference said the &ldquo;difficult decision&rdquo; had been made after reviewing the commission&rsquo;spreparations and &ldquo;following a careful of the logistics and operational plan&rdquo; the commission came to the conclusion that proceeding as scheduled was &ldquo;no longer feasible&rdquo;.
This decision by the country&rsquo;s electoral umpire has continued to attract scathing criticisms on social media, with many holding the opinion that the body has plans to rig the election in the favour of the ruling party, the APC.
Despite several assurances to Nigerians of its readiness to conduct the elections, INEC has faced difficulties over the past week with two of its offices have beengutted by firein suspicious incidents.
The candidate of the People&rsquo;s Democratic Party, PDP in the presidential race, Atiku Abubakar has also said that the postponement of elections in Nigeria by INEC, is a move byPresident Muhammadu Buhari to disenfranchise the Nigerian people.
According to him &ldquo;This postponement is obviously a case of the hand of Esau but the voice of Jacob. By instigating this postponement, the Buhari administration hopes to disenfranchise the Nigerian electorate in order to ensure that turn out is low on the rescheduled date.
&ldquo;The Buhari administration has had more than enough time and money to prepare for these elections and the Nigerian people were poised and ready to perform their civic responsibility by voting in the elections earlier scheduled for Saturday, 16 February 2019,&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Knowing that the Nigerian people are determined to reject them, they are desperate and will do anything in their power to avoid their rejection by the Nigerian people,&rdquo; he said.
Report of postponement comes after months of tense campaigning by the two leading candidates incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari of the APC and his main challenger, Atiku Abubakar of the PDP.
The postponement of the general elections in Nigeria has become an old story as the country has had last minute and late delays in previous elections. In 2015, the poll was shifted by six weeks due to security concerns at the peak of the Boko Haram insurgency. In 2011, the presidential election was delayed by a week after outbreaks of violence and claims of potential electoral fraud."
363,"The main opposition party in the last presidential election, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has alleged that the Nigerian military now shares the powers of President Muhammadu Buhari with him.
The PDP was reacting to the position of the US on the conduct of the 2019 elections, adding that theinvolvement of the military in the conduct of the elections had shown that the President had either abandoned his job or that the military were no longer ready to face their constitutional roles of defending the territorial integrity of the country.
The PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, made this known while reacting to the US assessment of the elections, adding that the military were behind the states whose elections were declared inconclusive by INEC.
According to him, the military practically took over the control of the elections by allegedly deciding who is to vote and if such a vote would count in many states.
Secondus also alleged that the military took over collation centres in states like Rivers and Bauchi, barring even officials of INEC from gaining access to the centres where votes were meant to be counted and collated.
According to him, &ldquo;It is not only the US that is disappointed; millions of Nigerians are also sad with the conduct of the elections. This is the first time in the history of elections in Nigeria that the military will be dictating the pace and whether the votes will count or not.
He said. &ldquo;We have all seen the report of INEC on Rivers State and others. It is obvious that the military have been sharing powers with the President. If this is not true, how can the military be the one to determine which results would be allowed into the collation centres?
&ldquo;The military have abandoned their constitutional roles of defending the territorial integrity of the nation. They have become an arm of a political party. This is dangerous for the nation. &ldquo;The military are helping the ruling party to kill the opposition in order to have a one party state. If that is allowed, then we may not have democracy again but a one party state. That are shameful and unacceptable.
Speaking further, he said &ldquo;The military are the one determining which state election is to be declared inconclusive with their actions, adding that ""democracy without opposition is no longer a government of the people by the people. Rather, it is a dictatorship government. We should all rise up and caution both the president and the military.&rdquo;"
364,"A list of five Justices of the Court of Appeal approved to hear the petition of Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar, over the February 23 election has been leaked by the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP).
In a statement issued by the coalition&rsquo;s national spokesman, Imo Ugochinyere, while addressing journalists in Abuja, the party said the list approved by the President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, &ldquo;with the endorsement of the Buhari APC.&rdquo; includes Bulkachuwa (Presiding Judge), Justice Abdu Aboki, Justice Peter O. Ige, Justice J. S. Ikyegh and Justice S. C. Oseji.
Ugochinyere noted that the position of the CUPP was that Bulkachuwa, Aboki and Ige should immediately recuse themselves from the panel because they are likely to be biased in favour of President Muhammadu Buhari.
According to him, while Bulkachuwa is a wife of a senator-elect on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Aboki and Ige had rejected Atiku&rsquo;s application for forensic analysis of the materials used for the presidential election.
He said, &ldquo;It is based on the foregoing and the evidence in the custody of the CUPP that we immediately, categorically and unambiguously demand that Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa, Justice Abdu Aboki and Justice Peter Ige recuse themselves from the panel.
&ldquo;The intelligence at our disposal, which formed the basis for all the views canvassed in this statement, is that these three Justices have already given their commitment to the Presidency that they will rule in favour of the President at the tribunal, hence they cannot dispense justice.
Continuing, he said ""Justices Aboki and Peter Ige, in furtherance of this commitment, had already and, very strangely so, denied Alhaji Atiku Abubakar his application for forensic analysis of the materials used for the presidential election.
&ldquo;We also demand that Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa recuse herself from the administrative duty of reconstituting the panel, but that should be done by an impartial senior Justice of the court.
&ldquo;This idea of the Villa approving list of Justices that will sit over any matter, particularly the one where the President is a party, is novel and tyranny taken too far.
&ldquo;The President has annexed the judiciary and the hope of the common man is blighted. Nigerians must rise in defence of the judiciary and insist that justicemust be done in this circumstance.
&ldquo;Let the world and Nigerians tell Justice Bulkachuwa not to take Nigerians for fools and bring the judiciary to further ridicule with her plan to constitute a tribunal panel that has been briefed with one agenda, which is to stamp the electoral robbery perpetrated by her husband&rsquo;s party, APC.
&ldquo;Announcing justices who have shown bias already to the case of Atiku, even at the preliminary stage of ordinary requests for forensic analysis of election materials, will not augur well for the stability of Nigeria and the institution/wheel of justice"" he said.
It would be recalled that after loosing the election to incumbent president, Muhhamadu Buhari, Abubakar rejected theyresults, claiming that they had being manipulated in favour of Buhari. He thendecided to drag the INEC to court. The PDP itself had accused the ruling APC of colluding with the leadership of INEC to manipulate the process.
"
365,"Embattled governor of Imo State, South East Nigeria, Rochas Okorocha has come hard o the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole for the party&rsquo;s woeful performance in the State during the last governorship election.
He equally lambasted the party governorship candidate in the state, Senator Hope Uzodinma, insisting that he was a &lsquo;mole&rsquo; in APC.
The APC had come a distant fourth in the March 9 election, which saw the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Emeka Ihedioha, emerge as winner.
While, Okorocha&rsquo;s son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, of the Action Alliance (AA) came second, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate in the state came third.
Okorocha who is yet to receieve his certificate of return as Senator by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC on grounds that he was declared winner under duress had vowed Nwosu will succeed him and did everything possible to see him emerge as APC governorship candidate for Imo State.
Reacting to the outcome of the election in a statement by his chief press secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo, Okorocha said posterity and history will judge Oshiomhole and Uzodinma for what happened to APC in the South-East, especially in Imo.
The statement read &ldquo;We had maintained that Chief Uzodinma was just a mole in the APC and today, the governorship election in the state and its outcome have obviously vindicated us, aside the fact that a video of Chief Uzodinma&rsquo;s celebration with Ihedioha has gone viral on the social media,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Chief Uzodinma succeeded through Adams Oshiomhole to ensure that only his supporters were made agents of the party, from the list he sent from Abuja to the Independent National Electoral Commission.
&ldquo;Unfortunately, none of Uzodinma&rsquo;s and Oshiomhole&rsquo;s approved agents were seen either at the ward, local government or at the state level ; they didn&rsquo;t care about the election and its outcome.
&ldquo;At the end of the day, the APC candidate came fourth. And he has been celebrating with the PDP candidate.
&ldquo;Their target as it has been shown now is to totally destroy APC in the South-East and in Imo in particular, thereby authenticating the claim in some quarters that it is all about 2023. The statemen further read."
368,"Former United State Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has expressed uncertainty over Atkiu&rsquo;s chances of winning the electoral dispute as the PDP candidatebegins his legal journey of trying to overturn the outcome of the 2019 Presidential elections.
Campbell also said that both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) were undemocratic in spirit and function primarily to contest elections rather than to promote legislation or policy.
This was contained in his article titled: &lsquo;Nigeria&rsquo;s Election Disappoints. where he alleged that the election was &ldquo;marred by historically low turnout and credible allegations of rigging&rdquo;.
He went on to say that it is unlikely the courts overturn the election result in favour of Atiku Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate.
He explained that while Abubakar says he will contest the election, Buhari&rsquo;s margin of victory&mdash;some four million votes&mdash;is so large that it is unlikely courts will overturn the result. &ldquo;Aside from some small pro-Abubakar demonstrations, Nigerians appear resigned to the outcome,&rdquo; he said.
Speaking on the situation of Nigeria&rsquo;s democracy, Campbell said; &ldquo;Nigeria&rsquo;s latest presidential election cycle has been bad news for democracy in Africa&rsquo;s most populous country and across the continent.
&ldquo;Though President Muhammadu Buhari won the election, it was marred by historically low turnout and credible allegations of rigging. &ldquo;Buhari and his main challenger, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, both Muslims from the Fulani ethnic group in the country&rsquo;s north, are part of the political class that has dominated Nigeria since independence in 1960"" he said.
speaking further, he said &ldquo;Their contest meant there would be no generational leadership change in a country where the average age is eighteen and half of registered voters are under thirty-five. Buhari, who spent much of his last term abroad for medical treatment, hardly campaigned at all.
&ldquo;Buhari and Abubakar are the standard-bearers for two political parties descended from the military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida: the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People&rsquo;s Democratic Party (PDP), respectively.
&ldquo;Both parties are undemocratic in spirit and function primarily to contest elections rather than to promote legislation or policy"" he added."
369,"President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has been appointed an &ldquo;Ambassador-at-Large&rdquo; of the International Human Rights Commission (IHRC).
In a letter dated March 16, 2019,the Diplomatic Head of the Commission to Nigeria and other African Countries, Ambassador Friday Sani, stated that sequel to the approval of the World Secretary General of the IHRC, Dr. Saraki has been appointed as one of the revered Ambassadors-at-Large of the multinational body.
It reads, &ldquo;While our role as a regional body is to promote and encourage institutions and persons to uphold human dignity across the world, we must not fail to mention the commendation of our Nigerian team over your resolute efforts in the stability of your country and your firm leadership of the Nigerian Senate which is adjudged to be among the most proactive parliaments across the world.
&ldquo;Besides, the Commission is not unmindful of the maturity that you recently displayed in the face of an obvious provocation in your constituency during the last Presidential and National Assembly elections,&rdquo; Ambassador Sani said in the letter.
In the new capacity, Dr. Saraki is expected to lead the diplomatic team of the IHRC in various diplomatic missions across the world.
The Senate President has accepted the nomination of the Commission, while also expressing his appreciation to the IHRC for his nomination."
370,"The Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC in Enugu, Emeka Ononamadu has called on Nigerians to imbibe the culture of participating in politics as it is a way of ensuring that democracy is achieved.
The REC made the call while addressing journalists during the Post 2019 general elections media briefing organized by the commission to enable the media and other critical stakeholders objectively access the INEC in terms of its inclusiveness, openness, credibility and results as well as management of issues and situations during the elections.
According to him, the need for improved political participation by the entire citizenry is compelling now more than ever before giving the dire craving for credible leaders who will take the country from its present position to where it ought to be.
He stated that it was the level of voter apathy that saw less than half a million voters coming to vote out of the 1.9 million people that registered and over 1.7 million Permanent Voters Cards, PVCs that were collected prior to the election.
Recalling the level of apathy that was recorded during the last presidential, National Assembly as well as state elections in the state, he noted that it is not the INEC alone that has the responsibility to encourage the general public on the need to always take part In the electoral process whenever it is time.
He however called on all relevant stakeholders to encourage citizens to always take part in the process of election at whatever level as it is a way of bringing in leaders with proven integrity instead of mere mediocre.
According to him, they must increase their level of awareness/ voter education as a way of ensuring that democracy is entrenched because there is an organic link between democracy and the development of any nation.
He also used the medium to commend the peaceful conduct of the general election in the state, insisting that it is a testimony that democracy is reaching its full maturity stage in the state and that it is hoped that other states across the country will emulate the level of peaceful conduct exhibited during the general elections.
He regretted that some political candidates, in their selfish bid to forcefully take power, tried to scuttle the process through falsely accusing the INEC and the security agencies of being biased in their activities.
&ldquo;We are studying those wide allegations for possibilities of seeking court redress because it is not only politicians that can always take the INEC to court. The INEC and its staff equally have a name to protect&rdquo; he said.
Speaking further, he said &ldquo;we are not going to tolerate reckless allegations that cast aspersions on our democracy and electoral process. We are moving towards a direction where nobody will get away with any unsubstantiated allegations that robs off on the credibility of an election&rdquo;
He further noted that the INEC was fully prepared for any post election events and activities and that the commission will conduct itself even better than it did during the elections as a way of proving to the people its readiness to serve.
&ldquo;Like INEC Enugu has repeatedly said, power belongs to the people and it is only they that give power and not INEC. Always keep faith with democracy since it is the best form of government&rdquo; he said.
He thanked the entire residents, traditional rulers, security agencies, civil society organizations, the media Corp members and the management and staff of INEC in the state for their relentless supports and efforts to make sure that the elections was completely hitch free.

371,"The national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole has said that former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar and csndidate of the Peopl's Democratic Party in the just concluded presidential election is not destined to lead the country.
He said this at a press conference at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja on Thursday while reacting to Atiku&rsquo;s description of the elections as the worst in Nigeria&rsquo;s history. Oshiomhole saidit was arrogance on the path of Atiku to think that the future of the country is tied to his presidency.
According to him, &ldquo;Atiku was not going to rule Nigeria against their wish? Citizens must hold their leaders accountable to their policy choices. Even when he said even if he if he will die he will sell NNPC many believed that he has collected deposit.
In his words, &ldquo;It borders on arrogance that our future is tied on his presidency. Atiku is destined never to be president of Nigeria. &ldquo;Leadership is about character. Atiku&rsquo;s desperation is so obvious, so desperate that in 2003, he challenged his own boss president Olusegun Obasanjo not to do a second term.&rdquo;
Oshiomhole insisted that the APC was rigged out in one of the states in the South South of Nigeria- Akwa Ibom state &ndash; reason Godswill Akpabio, serving senator, lost his reelection bid.
&ldquo;Rather than think that rigging has come to stay and why the numbers don&rsquo;t add up in the absence of massive rigging, I just think that he needs to be reminded that the essence of the collective effort that has been made, and all those who I can describe as genuine friends of Nigeria has been to try to improve the electoral process,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We have petition that we have written to INEC &ndash; how we were rigged out in Akwa Ibom state and it is interesting that it is PDP that is complaining about the outcome of election in Akwa Ibom state.

372,"The European Union (EU) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to strengthen Nigeria&rsquo;s democracy and unify its people, in line with the 2019 Abuja Peace Accord.
The EU made the plea in a letter formally congratulating President Buhari on his re-election as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, expressing willingness to work with Buhari&rsquo;s government.
In a letter dated March 22, 2019 and jointly signed by Donald Tusk for the European Council and Jean-Claude Juncker for the European Commission, the Union said:
On behalf of the EU, the letter read in part: &ldquo;We would like to congratulate you on your re-election as the President of Nigeria&rdquo;
&ldquo;We look forward to your leadership in strengthening democracy and uniting the country in line with the principles and spirit of the 2019 Abuja Peace Accord. The EU is willing to work with your government to follow up on the recommendations of our Election Observation Mission.&rdquo;
The EU, also, reiterated Nigeria&rsquo;s important position in world affairs and the Union especially, noting that what &ldquo;happens in Nigeria matters to the rest of the world, including to Europe.
&ldquo;Your commitment to an inclusive government offers an opportunity to take Nigeria forward in a way that meets your objectives of strengthening the economy, fighting corruption and improving security.
&ldquo;The EU has always partnered with Nigeria and its people. We look forward to continued and increased cooperation on bilateral and international matters.&rdquo;
The EU wished Buhari more successes in promoting peace and prosperity for all Nigerians as he enters the new mandate.
United States, China, Britain, AU and many governments had sent letters of congratulations to President Buhari."
373,"The persistent quest for white collar jobs has turned the minds of many graduates away from embarking on entrepreneurial ventures which are capable of transforming them into employers of labour instead of job seekers. Everyone wants to sit in an office well furnished with air conditions and giving out commands.
But sadly, the government of the day cannot possibly provide the whole number of employable youths in the country with job opportunities. Not even now when mediocrity has taken the place of meritocracy as a basis for employment. It is now a question of who you know rather than what you know.
The issue of unemployment for us has become a source of great concern. On the streets each day, you find a significant number of employable youths, most of whom have spent a number of years in the University all in the bid to acquire education.
After graduation, there are no jobs to show for the years spent. According to a report by Quartz Africa, Nigerian Tertiary Institutions produce as much as 500,000 graduates every year all of who throng the labour market in search of white-collar jobs, this is not excluding those who study abroad but later return home to compete for jobs. It is such an alarming figure.
A National Bureau of Statistics report also shows thatthe number of unemployed Nigerians rose by 3.3 million to 20.9 million in the third quarter of 2018 (Q3&rsquo;18). The report indicated that year-on-year (YoY), the rate of unemployment rose by 3.3 million or 19 percent from 17.6 million in Q3&rsquo;17 to 20.9 million in Q3&rsquo;18.
The statistics by NBS clearly paints a glaring picture of the long standing tradition of umployment in a country where the government and its functionaries even survive. but it also underscores the compelling need for the youth to learn to create jobs instead of depending on the government every now ad then for survival.
Speaking during the 1st Annual Youth conference organized by The Great Minds in collaboration with the National Youth Assembly of Nigeria, the founder, Women Aid Collective, Prof. Joy Ezeilo said that unemployment has increased the rate of poverty, inequality, social exclusion and intimidation and has led young people into drug trafficking, migration and human trafficking&rdquo;.
Prof. Ezeilo who spoke on the topic: Youth, Self-Reliance and Livelihood Sustainability rightly observed that the economy of the country has not been able to integrate the survival and future of the youths and it continues to be a source of great concern.
The theme of the conference was: The Restoration of Self-Help Among Nigerian Youths. It would not have come at a better time than now when there is an ever-increasing rate of social vices all of which have been blamed on the youths. The question, therefore is, what must be done?
There is every need to get rid of the notion that whoever is not gainfully employed after school has practically wasted his life in the university or polytechnic. Everyone must not be a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer or a politician.
It is important to note that economies around the world today are private driven. A perfect example is China where the private sector is the main driver of growth and employment. Between 2010 and 2012, private sector firms produced between two-thirds and three-quarters of China&rsquo;s GDP and also accounted for 90% of its exports according to a report by World Economic Forum.
The report by WEC also revealed that China has the world&rsquo;s largest foreign exchange reserves of 3.21 trillion US Dollars. Between 2005 and 2016, its total global investment and construction activities amounted to a value of about 1.2 trillion US Dollars. It is the world&rsquo;s largest exporter and the second largest importer of merchandise goods.
There is, therefore, the need for paradigm shift in the education curriculum at all levels. Much Emphasis should be placed on producing graduates who are creative and innovative, rather than merely focusing on bringing forth graduates whose heads are filled with theoretical teachings on professional vocations.
The youth must strive to free their head and their heart from stereotypes of the imperial world of globalization which merely favours western culture and lifestyle and try to be themselves. They must always engage their minds with good reasoning and the hands with great activities in the right direction.
Today, such skills as carpentry, tailoring, welding and livestock farming have been left for the uneducated. If the educated youths embrace these activities, the result will be an immeasurable economic revolution in Nigeria as everything the world applauds today in science and technology are outgrowths of little activities that were advanced to admirable products.
The issue of self-reliance should occupy the front burner of our national discourse because when achieved, it can pave the way for robust economic growth and creation of sustainable wealth in the country."
374,"President Muhammadu Buhari has said that only those with integrity and interest of Nigeria in heart will be considered in the next cabinet.
He also promised to appoint more women and youth during his second tenure, acknowledging that they played a &ldquo;significant role&rdquo; toward his re-election.
This is coming even as the candidate of the People&rsquo;s Democratic Party, PDP and leading opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar in the presidential election has decided to challenge the outcome of the polls in court.
The president had earlier said that his next four years in office as Nigeria&rsquo;s leader will be tough for him.
While speaking at a dinner organized by the All Progressives Congress (APC) women and youth to celebrate his re-election, on Saturday, Buhari assured that his administration would not disappoint them.
He explained that more fertilizers were being made available to Nigerian farmers at a lower rate, adding that this has resulted in an increase in agricultural production and reduction in food importation.
Buhari also called on Nigerian youth to embrace agriculture to ensure more food sufficiency and food export, insisting that the 16-year rule of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) &ldquo;wasted the nation&rsquo;s resources&rdquo;.
According to him, the country witnessed &ldquo;rampant infrastructure decay&rdquo; in spite of the huge resources earned during the period."
375,"Ahead of the 2019 general election, the political climate in Nigeria has witnessed what can be best described as a revolution, with the increasing number of the younger generation who have expressed an interest in running for various elective positions.



From the State House of Assembly to the governorship positions and from the National Assembly to the Presidency, the youth feel the time has come for the old breed of politicians to give way for a new crop of leaders who will change the narrative of the country.
In the past years, Nigeria has suffered from quite a number of setbacks- from harsh economic realities to widespread insecurity and from youth restiveness owing largely to unemployment to corruption in the government. And all through these years, the older generation have controlled the reigns of power. Nigeria's incumbent president, Muhhamadu Buhari is 76 years and he is seeking re-election in the Feburary 16 polls.
But the younger generation wants a change- a positives one. They are pushing for transformation, with the formation of political parties and movements. And moreso, with the signing of the Not Too Young to Run bill into law which wasthe outcome of relentless efforts by a coalition of more than 40 youth-based initiatives across the country.
On Saturday, November 10, at a gathering in Lagos, music star, Olubankole Wellington, 37, amid cheers from supporters, especially from the music industry, declared his intentions to run for the Federal House of Representatives in the 2019 general election.
The gathering was the debut convention of the Modern Democratic Party, a political party founded in 2017 by a group of youth associations which pushed for the Not Too Young To Run bill.
The Nigerian musician, who is known for his strong advocacy and unrelenting passion for voter education said that there is every need for a transformation in the body polity of the nation.
With the nations urge for younger candidates to take the reins and control the course of the future, Wellingtonhopeshis party, the MDP, can build a platform for younger and credible Nigerians who are committed to fixing the rot in the country.
According to Wellington, declaring interest to run is a dream come true as there is a need for renewed hope and results in a country that has consistently and persistently lagged behind in almost every sector.
Below is his keynote speech at the debut convention:

I have shared this vision with quite a few people. Some have been incredibly supportive, but some have advised against it. I am under no illusions that this will be easy. Considering whom we are going up against, it looks like it is impossible. They said we don&rsquo;t have money to run. But we want to say that our strength is in our numbers. They say we don&rsquo;t have the structure. But we say we will attempt to build it. They say, what if we lose and we say what if we win. We may not have a godfather. But we have God. We have intellectual capacity and integrity and the right intentions. We have a whole lot of hope that at the end of the day, it may very well be the only thing we have. But I truly believe that it is all we need.
Our generation needs a realistic rallying point. We need to begin in community, earn our way into the system and up the ladder. We need someone to stick their neck out and pave the way. The problem is that we&rsquo;ve always looked only to our leaders for change&hellip;instead of looking in the mirror and at the neighbors around us. Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that we are the ones we&rsquo;ve been waiting for all along?
It&rsquo;s incredible what can be achieved with a dream, the willingness to work hard, and the courage to hold on to hope in spite of the odds. I&rsquo;ve seen rock bottom create champions. I&rsquo;ve seen grass watered until it becomes known as grace. &ldquo;Hope&rdquo; is almost always the common denominator. Hope is what helped a former plantain seller and a kid born blind at birth become 2 of the most internationally acclaimed and successful Music Producers, from this same Nigeria.
Hope is what convinced 2 young Nigerians that they could take a company that at one point wasn&rsquo;t worth the paper it was registered on, and build it into one of the foremost Media and Entertainment Empires in the country. Hope is what convinced me that a scrawny little kid from Ojuelegba Shitta could one day become the biggest Artist on the African continent. Hope is what has helped me through 3 separate battles with skin cancer.
And to me, that&rsquo;s what tonight is all about&hellip;it&rsquo;s about this generation having the courage to hope again, and the will to work towards making our dreams for Nigeria, a reality. That&rsquo;s what we are attempting to do with MDP &ndash; the Modern Democratic Party.
You see, subconsciously, we&rsquo;ve kind of given up, haven&rsquo;t we? As a generation, we have essentially accepted that things will never change. We&rsquo;ve lost hope. It&rsquo;s why more people vote in Big Brother Africa than in our General Elections. It&rsquo;s why most of us are too busy to register for a PVC, but we&rsquo;ll stand in line for days at the VISA Center &ndash; further proof that nowadays, for the average citizen, the ultimate Nigerian Dream is the one in which you get to escape Nigeria.
I realized that all my years of activism in Nigeria didn&rsquo;t amount to much more than my plight as an Arsenal fan. You see, as Arsenal fans, we love our club, but we knew it was time for change. We complained, we tweeted, we held up banners at the stadium, we shouted and hashtagged for many years.
But until the people who were a part of the system &ndash; the board, the shareholders, the executives etc &ndash; untiltheydecided that it was time for change, all of that noise would not have amounted to anything. Our former coach could have remained in that position until the day that he died.. and there&rsquo;s not a damn thing any of us could have done about it.
The same can be said for Nigeria. Until the day that we decide as a generation, to get involved with the affairs of our country, nothing willeverreally change. The time has come for us to play our part. We can no longer afford to remain mere spectators.
Getting a voter&rsquo;s card alone is no longer enough; because that does not give you a say in putting up the kind of candidates that you believe in. We must take things one step further by building a new political platform for this generation. One that is not built for selfish interests. But one that is built off of a shared vision and ideals. One that will put up the right kind of candidates: people with Integrity, the right intentions and the intellectual capacity to lead. People with vision and the ability to execute.
Make no mistake,we area generation in a battle for the soul and direction of our country, but wearestuck in a lose-lose situation. But when you&rsquo;re in a lose-lose situation, you don&rsquo;t pick sides. You change the situation. It&rsquo;s time for us to do that. It&rsquo;s time for us to hope and believe again. It&rsquo;s time for us to work and build.
25 years ago, the majority of Nigerians overwhelmingly bought into a vision called &ldquo;Hope &lsquo;93.&rdquo; We had the freest and fairest elections in our Nation&rsquo;s history and elected a great man called MKO Abiola into the Presidency. May his soul rest in peace, and his sacrifice not be in vain.
Our Country&rsquo;s trajectory might have been very different, had he been allowed to live and assume his rightful position. Back then, it didn&rsquo;t even matter that he fielded an all Muslim ticket&hellip;because poverty, lack, and suffering do not discriminate. Unemployment, lack of infrastructure, a declining educational system, poor healthcare, gender inequality&hellip;these are issues all Nigerians are struggling with whether we are Christian, Muslim, or Atheist&hellip;Yoruba or Igbo, Hausa or Ijaw, Edo or Delta, Efik or Kanuri.
Our generation does not really believe in the existing powers that be on both sides of the divide and for good reason. We have been taken advantage of and lied to.. we are tired and disenfranchised. We are frustrated and suspicious. We don&rsquo;t believe in our current political options, so it&rsquo;s time for us to build our own. We want a seat at the table of Governance in Nigeria, but we must bring our own chair. Because if we are to get into leadership, itmustbe on our own terms and conditions, with our own vision and set of ideals&hellip;otherwise, we risk being marginalized and handcuffed by the same systems we are criticizing.
And this vision is for beyond 2019, and for more than just the office of the President. It&rsquo;s about every electable office in this country. We must start now to build a movement towards 2023 and beyond, otherwise, in every election, we will find ourselves in this exact same spot.
We want to fix Nigeria, but we must begin by rebuilding our communities. Everybody seems so obsessed with the Presidential race &ndash; it&rsquo;s one of the most frequent suggestions I get &ndash; &ldquo;Banky W, run for President.&rdquo; But see, as I said earlier, I do believe in dreaming big, but I believe in starting small and working your way up. Hope is what we needed in &rsquo;93. 25 years later, hope is what we&rsquo;ll need in 2019. And it is with the greatest sense of humility, purpose, and destiny, that I announce my candidacy for the 2019 Federal House of Representatives, in the Eti Osa constituency of Lagos State.
With the rate of youth inclusion in politics, it is hoped that the country will soon be ushered into an entirely new political dispensation. But everyone only needs to keep their hands crossed and wait for the outcome of the polls.

376,"On a Wednesday afternoon, about 45 women gathered at the Main Auditorium of the 82 Division Enugu. They were the wives of soldiers who died in active service and those who suffered varying degrees of injuries in the war against insurgency.
The women, numbering 45, alongside some wounded soldiers had all gathered to receive cash assistance from the Enugu State Government. Comfortable seated at the auditorium, their faces shone with expressions of excitement and expectation.
Presenting the cash to the widows and other beneficiaries on behalf of the Enugu State Governor , Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, the special adviser to the governor on security matters, rtd. Brigadier Gen. Fredrick Eze said the cash being disbursed was in fulfillment of the promise the governor made to the widows on Armed Forces Remembrance Day.
He commended the army for their unrelenting efforts in partnering with other security agencies in the state to make sure that the culture of peace is sustained, adding that the state government has done enough for the security operatives in the state in terms of the provision of necessary logistics.
&ldquo;The state government has had a cordial working relationship with security agencies in the state and this is reflected in the relative peaceful the state has enjoyed over the years&rdquo;. He said.
Eze used the medium to call on the security operatives to make sure that absolute peace is maintained in the state, before, during and after the general election that is scheduled to begin on Saturday.
While explaining that the widows of the fallen soldiers will each receive 300,000 while those who were wounded will be given 160,000 each, the General Officer Commanding, (GOC), 82 Division of the Nigerian Army, Abubakar Sadiq said that it was part of efforts put in place by the state government to rub smiles on the face of those whose husbands have given themselves in defense of the country.
He thanked the state governor for his support to the widows of the fallen soldiers and other beneficiaries, even as he called on them to make judicious use of the money.
&ldquo;We heartily extend our condolences to those of you whose husbands have died or were wounded and we do pledge our continued support to you and your families&rdquo;. He said.
Some of the beneficiaries could not hide their joy at the extent of love shown to them by the state government even as they promised to make judicious use of the money in taking care of their needs.
Harrison Unusotame, one of the wounded soldiers said he did not expect the gesture from the state government. He thanked the governor whom he described as humane and promised to make judicious use of the money."
377,"United Nations Deputy Secretary General, Amina Mohammed on Saturday said thatAfrica cannot have sustainable development without sustaining peace
Mohammed spoke at the 20th Session of the Regional Coordination Mechanism for Africa (RCM-Africa) and the Third Joint Meeting of the Regional United Nations Sustainable Development Group in Marrakesh, Morocco, accotding to a statement issued by the Communications Section Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
According to her, it is crucial for Africa to turn the pages of conflict, where it remains on the continent, and start building peace that in turn can transition into sustainable development.
&ldquo;We cannot have sustainable development without sustaining peace, neither can we build a secure future for everyone without addressing the root causes of our conflicts and vulnerabilities,&rdquo; she told participants gathered to discuss and generate solutions to the continent&rsquo;s refugee and internally displaced persons challenge.
Mohammed added that climate change, rising inequalities, persistent gender discrimination, lack of social cohesion, &lsquo;conflicts in its many different forms, deteriorating political consensus and the mass movement of people across borders are signs of the hindrance we are having to face. Challenges that know no borders and cannot be resolved through solutions of the past&rsquo;.
She said viable solutions were possible, especially as the United Nations and the African Union Commission continue to work together.
&ldquo;We do go further when we join hands for a common cause, on common grounds and when we bring the best of our assets and leadership around the continent,&rdquo; the UN Deputy Chief said as she applauded the strong AU-UN partnership.
&ldquo;Today offers the opportunity to recognize our common challenges and maximize the impact of our regional work. The RCMs can help to galvanize and accelerate progress towards the sustainable development goals in various areas, including integration across all dimensions of sustainable development, as well as integration across development, humanitarian and peace,&rdquo; she said.
She added: &ldquo;The clock is ticking on 2030 and 2063 Agendas, and we will only truly be successful in the reforms if we can accelerate our actions or scale-up to the SGDs. It is a collective responsibility and we are engaging with a greater urgency to deliver. We have to find our courage, ingenuity and the means to rise to the ambition of our actions and move with far greater speed.&rdquo;
Mohammed also spoke about the need for Africa to do all it could to ensure the potential of its youth is realized, adding more also needs to be done to close the gender gap.
She said Africa hosts the largest number of displaced persons worldwide, with factors including political upheaval, food insecurity, and poverty, among others being major driving forces.
&ldquo;Whatever the cause or crises, Africa&rsquo;s response has been admirable; countries have demonstrated remarkable solidarity, often despite the little means that we have,&rdquo; said Ms. Mohammed.
She said through its successive reform programmes, the UN had been working to create a more coherent, effective and efficient support and delivery mechanism to guarantee a better life for all citizens of the world without leaving &lsquo;no one behind&rsquo;.
But, she added, the data that had emerged suggested that &lsquo;we are not on track to meet the 2030 Agenda, which means that we need to accelerate to meet the ambitions we have set for ourselves&rsquo;.
&ldquo;In 2019, we will have a defining year to deliver on the promises we have made to humanity through Africa 2063 Agenda and the global 2030 Agenda,&rdquo; Ms. Mohammed added.
The two-day meeting, organized by the Economic Commission for Africa and the AUC, also aims to deliberate on the functioning of the RCM-Africa and the Africa Regional United Nations Sustainable Development Group platforms, and also assess achievements, challenges and the way forward in strengthening the coherent and efficient delivery of support to the African Union and its organs in the context of African Union and United Nations reforms."
378,"Former President Goodluck Jonathan has said that there is no reason for him to quit the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), or retire from politics completely for now.
He made this known yesterday, through his Media Adviser, Mr. Ikechukwu Eze, whil reacting to a report which claimed that the ex-president had resigned from PDP and quit politics.
The statement described the news as fake and a &ldquo;calculated attempt to rubbish the elder statesman&rdquo;.

The statement read &ldquo;The PDP gave Jonathan the platform to serve as deputy governor, governor, vice president and eventually President of Nigeria. Jonathan has no reason at this time to resign his membership of the platform. &ldquo;Those who derive pleasure in spreading fake information had better occupy themselves with more productive endeavours that are obviously more relevant to nation building.
&ldquo;Obviously, this is a fabrication borne out of mischief as the publishers of the fake story claimed that the former President made the statement while being interviewed by theNigeria News Agency (NNA).
&ldquo;There is absolutely no way the former President could have spoken to a non-existent news agency, as none in the country goes by that name,&rdquo; the statement added.
"
379,"Before the incumbent governor of Enugu State, Eastern Nigeria, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi was declared winner of last Saturday&rsquo;s governorship election, Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu had predicted he would win the election.
Ekweremadu who voted at about 10:28 am- Nigerian time- at his Polling Unit in Amachalla, Mpu, Aninri local government said that Enugu state is essentially a PDP state and that the governor has done extremely well to deserve a second term.
Ekweremadu said the governor deserved a landslide victory as he is the only candidate who went round the state campaigning and seeking the support of people in the state.
According to him, ""You can&rsquo;t get votes when you don&rsquo;t campaign so it is obvious he will win&rdquo;.
Describing the process at his Polling Unit as smooth, he said there was an improvement in the election compared to the presidential and National Assembly polls.
&ldquo;The card reader seems to be working today, at least for now, and I believe that even the atmosphere itself is also cordial. This is exactly what a voting environment should look like. I just hope and believe that the same thing is happening across the country&rdquo;, he said.
&ldquo;I can only speak for where I am right now. I have voted and I am happy with the process here. The voters are orderly and the security men are also responsible in their behavior. The ad hoc staff are also very responsive and doing the job as expected.
He however regretted that there appeared to be a general low turnout of voters across the country.

380,"The Federal Government has condemned in the most strong terms, the terrorist attack on two places of worship in the city of Christchurch in New Zealand.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Geoffrey Onyeama, made this known in a statement by the Ministry&rsquo;s Spokesperson, Mr George Edokpa, on Friday in Abuja.
Onyeama condemned the attacks which took place during Jumaat Prayers on Friday, March 15, which left 49 Muslim worshippers dead and several others injured.
The minister who regretted the barbaricand vicious acts unleashed against innocent worshippers expressed Nigeria&rsquo;s sympathies to New Zealand.
&ldquo;Nigeria stands in solidarity with New Zealand in their time of grief and fully supports the prosecution of the perpetrators of this heinous crime to the fullest extent of the law,&rdquo; he said.
He condoled with the government and the people of New Zealand and prayed for God to grant the families of the victims the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss and wished the injured speedy recovery.
It would be recalled that an unknown gunman stormed the premises of Linwood and Dean's Avenue mosques and shot sporadically at people who were gathered for Friday prayer devotion.
Reports brought by police investigation have shown that of the dead victims,41 people lost their lives at the Deans Avenue mosque shooting, while 7 died on Linwood Avenue. It also stated that one of the victims passed away at Christchurch Hospital where doctors also confirmed that children were among the victims of the heinous act.
Video footage widely circulated via social media, plausibly taken by the gunman and posted online exactly moment of the attacks, showed him driving to one mosque as he played music in his car."

The event, which marks the 5th round of the Foundation&rsquo;s Entrepreneurship Programme, will take place at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja.
Every year, the Tony Elumelu Foundation opens its application portal to African entrepreneurs, with businesses of less than three years old. Through its $100million Entrepreneurship Programme, the Foundation empowers 1,000 entrepreneurs annually, who receive $5,000 in non-refundable seed capital, access to mentors, a 12-week training programme and opportunities to promote their businesses to a global audience.
In the five years since the Foundation launched its Entrepreneurship Programme, it has empowered 4,000 African entrepreneurs directly and an additional 470 entrepreneurs supported by the Foundation&rsquo;s partners.
All applicants receive access to TEFConnect, Africa&rsquo;s digital entrepreneurial hub, which provides access to networks, training, further capital sources and business opportunities.
As a means of cascading its proven entrepreneurial tool kit to the huge numbers of applicants, the Foundation launched in 2018, TEFConnect, the digital networking platform for African entrepreneurs.
The platform, which has currently over 400,000 users, providing opportunities for entrepreneurs to network, receive training and forge business partnerships to scale their businesses beyond physical borders.
The Foundation only recently appointed Ifeyinwa Ugochukwu as CEO effective from April 1. Ugochukwu succeeds Parminder Vir, OBE, who will continue to lend her experience and expertise as a member of the Foundation&rsquo;s Advisory Board.
The incoming CEO, Ifeyinwa Ugochukwu, emphasised the importance of partnership in reaching additional entrepreneurs beyond the Foundation&rsquo;s annual commitment of 1,000 entrepreneurs.
In her words &ldquo;each year we see a significant uplift in applicants. Our execution partner, Accenture Development Partnerships, are currently reviewing and finalising the applications.
&ldquo;Over 215,000 African entrepreneurs applied from across 54 African countries, up from 151,000 applications last year, with an increase in female representation from 62,000 in 2018 to 90,000 in 2019&rdquo;. &ldquo;These rising figures demonstrate the burning desire of the African entrepreneur to develop our continent, and we must urgently convert this passion into viable businesses to develop our continent&rdquo; she said.

382,"The families of the 157 persons who died in the Ethiopian Airlines (ET) plane crash on Sunday may sue the aircraft manufacturer, Boeing and its insurers, for compensation to the tune of N762.5 million ($2.5 million) per person.
The chances of lawsuits and favourable hearing brightened yesterday when the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) admitted similarities between Sunday&rsquo;s crash and a previous one in Asia, about five months ago.
The connection, if fully established in the ongoing investigation, would make Boeing liable to faulty plane claims.
The American government late Wednesday bowed to international pressure to ground the B737Max 8 and 9 airplanes, following serious safety concerns after Sunday&rsquo;s crash in Ethiopia. Till date, over 41 countries, including Nigeria, have banned the aircraft from their airspaces.
U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters that the &ldquo;safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hopefully, they will come up with an answer but until they do, the planes are grounded,&rdquo; Trump said.
According to the FAA acting chief, Daniel Elwell, the agency has been &ldquo;working tirelessly&rdquo; to find the cause of the accident but faced delays because the black box flight data recorders have been damaged.
The new information shows &ldquo;the track of that airplane was close enough to the track of the Lion Air flight, to warrant the grounding of the airplanes so we could get more information from the black boxes and determine if there&rsquo;s a link between the two, and if there is, find a fix to that link,&rdquo; Elwell said.
But the implication is far-reaching for Boeing. Though the initial insurance payments will be made by the Ethiopian Airlines&rsquo; insurers, they may look to recoup their money from Boeing&rsquo;s insurers, if they can prove that the aircraft was faulty, a source said.
A plane headed to Nairobi, Kenya from Addis Ababa where some of the passengers would be attending the United Nations&rsquo; environmental conference had crashed killing all 149 passengers and 8 crew members.
Meanwhile, the University of Ibadan community has staged a walk in honour of one of the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines&rsquo; plane crash, Pius Adesanmi- aforemost Nigerian professor and 56 others.




Deans of faculties, heads of departments and other professors participated in the walk from the university main gate to the Faculty of Arts and Humanities.
Former Dean, Faculty of Arts, Prof. Remi Raji-Oyelade, said the deceased was a driving spirit for many academic achievements in the institution.
He narrated his last dialogue with Adesanmi, concluding that the crash victim had the feeling of his imminent death. &ldquo;We had been talking for the past three weeks and Pius kept mentioning death. I believe he saw his death coming.&rdquo;
Raji-Oyelade said that the nation should take solace in the legacy and immense contribution of Adesanmi to the development of literature, Africa and humanity.

383,"A professor of political economy and former presidential candidate, Pat Utomi, has described politicians who spend more than 12 years in public offices as social parasites who are only concerned about their personal gains.
Utomi made this comment on Saturday during an interview aired on ARISE TV.
in his words &ldquo;I despise people who live on politics. I think that people who make a career in life based on politics are doing society a disservice,&rdquo;"". &ldquo;I have said that nobody should hold public office for more than 12 consecutive years. You go from a commissioner to the governor, senator; you are a social parasite.
speaking further, he said &ldquo;You should come out of your hard work, make a difference for four to eight years and go back to what you do. If it&rsquo;s not like that for you, you are a parasite to society. The characters making it difficult to make progress are social parasites who call themselves politicians.&rdquo;
Utomi, who contested for the Delta state governorship ticket under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said Nigeria needs a national redemption mission.
&ldquo;You should create a cabinet of rivals, Yakubu Gowon did it. He built a cabinet of people who were more capable than himself.. Awolowo, Enahoro, Shagari and co.
He insisted that the country does not need warlords who only try to take undue advantage of the resources the country is blessed with but those who have love in their hearts for the people of this country.
Utomi further stressed that serious-minded people who care about the country will not give up even when warlordskeep trying shut them out.

384,"With the presidential election just five days away, the people of the South East have continued to express their support for the candidate of the People's Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar who they believe has got the right answers to the questions that have been on their lips.
On a certain Monday morning in Enugu, former South East Capital, The Eastern People&rsquo;s Front, EPS threw their weight behind the candidacy of Atiku Abubakar in the presidential election insisting that no sane individual of Igbo extraction will agree to vote for the APC- led administration for a second term in office looking at how poorly they have managed the affairs of the country.
Abubakar had chosen Peter Obi of Igbo extraction and a former governor of Anambra State as his running mate.
The forumsaid that 2019 presidential election is a defining one for Nigeria and is very crucial and critical to the continued co-existence and survival of the Igbo people and provides accelerated pathway for Nigeria president of Igbo extraction through a major political party.
While addressing newsmen during its National Executive Committee meeting ahead of the presidential election, the National President of EPF, Elder Ken Emechebe said that the forum have since the 2019 electioneering process started, studied, consulted and placed side-by-side the governance programs of the president and the APC with that of his closest competitor, Atiku Abubakar who in their estimation has made proposals that suit the ideals of Ndigbo.
He stated that the forum does not hate president Buhari and the ruling APC government as generally stated, but is rather only neither amenable to his character as a leader nor to his politics.
&ldquo;We have been wrongly perceived as a menace to the peace of other Nigerians, yet we are not. We have been unjustifiably killed by our country men, yet we hold out love for humanity anywhere. Our resources have been plundered time and time again, yet we rebuild and continue to create wealth for the society&rdquo;. He said.
He regretted that &ldquo;The Nigeria- Biafra war was supposed to have ended in 1970, but it is being prolonged against the Igbo people by those who have the power to end it, but chose not to. Instead, they have continued to mischaracterize the Igbo people and their Igbo nature to live and promote one Nigeria in every part of the Nigeria&rdquo;.
According to him, the decision of the EPS to support Atiku and urge all Igbos to massively cast their votes for him and the PDP at the presidential election is based on his stance on the restructuring of the country, enthronement of true federalism, and creation of an enabling environment for all Nigerians to thrive.
&ldquo;Our choice of Atiku and the PDP is based on our estimation that the chances of a Nigerian president from Ndigbo in 2023 is most feasible therein than it could be with Buhari and the APC which has shown that it has a closed mind towards the Igbo nation&rdquo;
Speaking further, he said &ldquo;We have about 26.7 million Igbo registered voters. We do hope that about 17 million of them will come out and vote for Atiku in the election so as to show him how committed we are in making the country a better place with him&rdquo;.
He stated that the Igbo people will not be stampeded, cowed or intimidated on election day and that they will remain wherever they registered to vote and also warned that whoever decides to provoke they people in their peaceful way will be rebuffed.
Meanwhile, former minister of Power and member of the NEC of the EPF, Prof. Chinedu Nebo has describe as faceless, nameless and uncelebrated the faction of Ohanaeze led by former Secretary-General, Uche Okwukwu that visited and apologized to president Buhari, for the announced endorsement of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar for the 2019 elections by the main body.
Speaking during the NEC meeting, Nebo said that there are no two Ohanaeze Ndigbo and so, whoever went behind to speak against the decision making body is only pursuing selfish interest and not speaking for the Igbo nation.
It will be recalled that Okwukwu opposed the endorsement of the PDP candidate by the president of Ohanaeze, Nnia Nwodo and later announced that President Buhari had been adopted as the Presidential candidate of Ohaneze, a development which attracted his expulsion by the body.
Reacting to this, Nebo said that the position of Ohanaeze Ndigbo is to stand by any leader who has the interest of the Igbo nation at heart because the body represents the corporate vision for the emancipation of the Igbo race.
&ldquo;There is absolute neglect of the Igbo nation. Our people are being slaughtered in their thousand, yet, our government is not saying anything. It is a clear indication of the hatred of our people. Our only hope therefore is the massive support of Atiku Abubakar and his running mate, Peter Obi in the coming election.&rdquo;
The EPF is a forum of Igbo leaders and stakeholders from across Nigeria, who are working assiduously to reposition Ndigbo in the Nigerian political equation and to build bridges of friendship and cooperation with other geo political zones based on mutual trust, respect and understanding.

385,"It was a blacck Saturday as kidnappers struck and abducted two expatriates, working with the Nigerian Delta Petroleum Resources in Ogbele, Abua/Odua Local Government Area of Rivers State, on Saturday at about 7.30pm.
The abduction of the two expatriates, a Scot and a Canadian, is coming just two days after two workers of Dutch oil giants, Shell, were kidnapped while traveling from Yenogoa, the Bayelsa capital to Port Harcourt, Rivers State.
The kidnappers, who took their victims to an unknown location, have however not made any contact with anyone concerning their victims more than 24.hours after their abduction.
Thr Rivers State Police Command&rsquo;s spokesman, Nnamdi Omoni, who confirmed the incident, said the state Police Commissioner, Usman Belel, has orders immediate investigation in order to rescue the victims.
He said: &ldquo;We have intensified efforts towards ensuring that they are rescued. The feelers I have is that we are closing in on them (kidnappers).
&ldquo;The state Commissioner of Police has directed the commanders of all the tactical units and some others to relocate and ensure urgent response to the situation.&rdquo;"
386,"Millions of dollars have reportedly been found at the residence of former President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan.
Al-Bashir, it will be recalled, was toppled in a military coup which took place on April 11. He was initially placed under house arrest before being transferred to Kobar prison, where he detained some of his critics while in power.
In a statement, the senior public prosecutor in Sudan Mutasim Mahmoud, announced the seizure of $351 million, &euro;6,7 million, and SDG 5 billion ($105 million) at the residence of Al-Bashir.
Mahmoud confirmed that the cash is secure within the vaults of the Bank of Sudan, and that charges will be filed against the former president under the foreign exchange and money laundering law.
Part of the cash was packed in sacks designed for 50kg of maize meal according to media reports.
A source in Sudan&rsquo;s judiciary was quoted to have said that suitcases loaded with more than $351,000, &euro;6m ($6.7m; &pound;5.2m) and five billion Sudanese pounds ($105m) were found at Bashir&rsquo;s home.
The agency said the source also confirmed that Bashir was under investigation and that prosecutors would &ldquo;question the former president in Kobar prison&rdquo;.
Bashir is reportedly wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes in the country&rsquo;s Darfur region but the military which is in charge of the country has vowed not to extradite him.
The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which organised the protests that forced al-Bashir out of power, has expressed dissatisfaction with the military taking control of the country but the military council has resisted calls to hand over power to a civilian body.
The association has vowed to stay on the streets until there is a move to civilian rule."

As the Nationa Assembly prepares to resume its 9th Assembly, the Coalition of South East Civil Society an Human Rights Organizations have thrown their weight behind Nkeiruka Onyejeocha as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Addressing newsmen in Enugu, the chairman, Political Committee of the Coalition, Jasper Uche, said that Onyejeocha, whorepresents theIsuikwuato/Umunneochiconstituency in Abia State- South East Nigeria-has not been indicted or involved in any scandal all through her stay at the National Assembly.

He maintained that she has sponsored a number of bills including the Local Government Autonomy, the Anti- torture bill and the gun shot victims compulsory treatment bills, all of which drew national attention.

Noting that Onyejeocha's re-election for the fourth time clearly shows the level of confidence reposed in her, Uche said that the coalition also hinged their demand on the fact that the South East region has held the senate president, Deputy senate president an deputy speaker positions since return to democracy in 1999.

He maintained that the selection of Onyejeocha as speaker will help to douse the tension and also assuage the feeling of exclusion and marginalization of the South East region.

He also stated that It will further change the perception held by many that president Muhammadu Buhari dislikes the Igbo race completely.

""In the National Tripod, the North West ha the president, the south West has the Vice- president. The South East should therefore take the speaker since the zone has held Senate President and deputy senate president for over two terms"" he said.

He recalled that Abia State, where Onyejeocha comes from, like other states in the South East, gave Buhari the needed 25% votes which shows their level of support and readiness to work with him.

Also speaking during the event, the cor-odinator of Civil Liberty Organization and Centre for Development and Media Advocacy, Onyebuchi Igboke recalled that the president promised to form a national government through the appointment of officers from the entire region in the country.

""Part of the ways through which the president can show the people that he Is out to represent their interest this time is to grant our request and make Onyejeocha speaker of the house of representatives in the 9th Assembly"" he said.

390,"The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the reaction by President Muhammadu Buhari's camp to the interview granted by a top official of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), confirming the existence of a central election results transmission serverin the commission, further exposes its anxiety.
The PDP said the interview, which is now everywhere, speaks volumes about the reported denial by INEC of the existence of such a server for the 2019 general elections as well as the frenzy by Buhari&rsquo;s team to distract the Presidential election petitions tribunal by externalizing its proceedings.
The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Thursday said this was in addition to the presidency&rsquo;s attempt to divert public attention by engaging in judicial interpretations and hauling insults on the party and candidate, Atiku Abubakar.
&ldquo;The lesson for all in the latest episode is in the undying verity that no matter how long falsehood appears to thrive, the truth will always come to light and prevail at the end of the day&rdquo;, the statement read.
It further read &ldquo;Instead of this pitiable resort to frenetic and chaotic play to the gallery, the PDP counsels President Buhari and his team to focus on facing the course of justice at the tribunal. &ldquo;The PDP further advises President Buhari and his team to curtail their desperation and respect the sanctity and integrity of the Court of Appeal by ending their externalization of proceedings, which has been their calculated scheme to distract the court and derail the course of Justice.
&ldquo;The PDP and our candidate, Atiku Abubakar, are full of respect for the court and will never join President Buhari&rsquo;s team in engaging in actions that tend to undermine independence and sanctity of the judiciary.
&ldquo;Our party stands firmly with Nigerians in our determination to retrieve our stolen mandate in the court and no amount of shenanigans by the APC and the Buhari team will distract us or detract from the resolve of Nigerians in their expectation of the triumph of their will at the tribunal.&rdquo;"
391,"The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has alleged that about N14 trillion has been stolen under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The PDP made the allegation in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan on Sunday, adding that the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC and President Muhammadu Buhari were desperate to remain in power in order to prevent investigations into the matter.
According to Ologbondiyan, the stolen funds included the N9tn allegedly stolen from the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, as detailed in the leaked Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation&rsquo;s memo; the over N1.4tn alleged oil subsidy sleaze and the N1.1tn worth of crude allegedly diverted using 18 unregistered companies.
Others, according to the statement included the N33bn National Emergency Management Agency fund, and the over N18bn allegedly stolen out of the N48bn approved by the National Assembly in the 2017 budget for the rehabilitation of internally displaced persons in the North-East among others.
The party also claimed that the unbridled borrowing by the Buhari administration has led to the monumental increase in the nation&rsquo;s debt from N12.12tn in 2015 to N24.39tn in 2018.
According to Ologbondiyan, the Buhari administration borrowed N12.27tn in three years without anything to show for it.
&ldquo;The President Muhammadu Buhari-led Presidency and the APC are desperate to remain in power at all costs, so as to continue to exploit Nigerians, protect the APC corrupt leaders, cover their incompetence and conceal the humongous sleazes in their administration.
&ldquo;This is the reason the APC and the cabal at the incompetent Buhari Presidency resorted to violence, intimidation as well as manipulations and alteration of results at the Independent National Electoral Commission to rig the February 23 presidential election.
&ldquo;This also explains why the APC&rsquo;s agents and certain presidential aides have been making desperate efforts to distract the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal and derail the course of justice by making and promoting baseless judicial interpretations and externalising the proceedings of the court.
&ldquo;The PDP urges Nigerians not to despair but continue to be steadfast in the aspiration for the recovery of the stolen presidential mandate at the tribunal, as this is the only way to return our nation to the path of peace, national unity and a vibrant economy&rdquo;, the statement read in part."

Biden, who was former President Barack Obama&rsquo;s deputy, made his presidential bid announcement in a video in which he criticized Trump.

&ldquo;I believe it will be Crazy Bernie Sanders vs. Sleepy Joe Biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best Economy in the history of our Country (and MANY other great things)! I look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God Rest Their Soul!&rdquo;, Trump tweeted."

He made the statement on Tuesday when he declared open the 2019 Nigerian army infantry corps conference in Jaji, Kaduna State, adding that bandits do not come from the moon.
Buratai, however, appealed the support of Nigerians in the fight against insurgency. He explained that insurgents live among ordinary citizens and patronise the same markets, therefore intelligence gathering was necessary.
According to him, &ldquo;terrorism is quite a complex phenomenon and situation that requires a more comprehensive approach, which comprises in totality of government, and the involvement of every individual in the country.&rdquo;
He explained that the army is employing maximum intelligence in its efforts to combat and contain all forms of insurgencies.
&ldquo;Bandits or insurgents don&rsquo;t come from the moon, they are everywhere, they go to markets to make purchases, interact with people every now and then, hence the need for information and intelligent gathering and sharing to help achieve the required results,&rdquo; Buratai said.
&ldquo;The Nigerian armed forces will continue to discharge their duties in the protection of the territorial integrity of the country.
&ldquo;The change in the Nigeria army and its innovation are quite outstanding. With our collective effort with other security agencies, we were able to deal decisively with the Boko Haram insurgences.
&ldquo;Today we have the full initiative in collaboration with the members of Multi National Joint Task Force countries, we are working hard to ensure that we finally sanitise the northern part of Borno, our border fringes with Niger, Chad and Cameroon.
&ldquo;Within the hinterlands, some of them are still hibernating in the remote areas, they are planing and we are also planning to counter them.
&ldquo;We will ensure that we employ the maximum intelligence required to contain those within the hinter land.
&ldquo;If this is done, we will be able to contain insurgency at anytime it rears its ugly head. It cannot be left to the traditional rulers, local government chairmen, state governors or the federal government institutions like the military, police or the Armed Forces alone. It is the collective responsibility of everybody.
&ldquo;Every individual and society has a role to play. If the overall populace sees it as their own responsibility to support government and security agencies, it means we are going to resolve every security issues in the country.&rdquo;"
395,"Leaders of major groups across five regions in Nigeria have thrown their weight behind the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar&rsquo;s decision to drag President Muhammadu Buhari to court.
Atiku, who lost the February 23 presidential election to incumbent President Buhari, had insisted he was rigged out and vowed to challenge the outcome of the polls in court.
The leaders under the aegis of Forum of Nigerian Leaders and Elders gave their backing for Atiku after reviewing events that took place during the presidential and National Assembly elections.
According to them, the polls &ldquo;revealed massive irregularities and outright abuse of the electoral laws, the rules and regulations of INEC (Independent National Electoral Commission).&rdquo;
They claimed that security personnel on duty during the elections failed to maintain neutrality and operate within the highest standards of their calling.

The leaders also went further to say that the Peace Accord signed by the presidential candidates &ldquo;was ridiculed by deliberate and open abuse of organs of the state, the denial of rights of many citizens to vote and blatant abuse of all the commitments made by the administration.&rdquo;

They had been called up by the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC prof. Mahmood Yakubu who was to present a certificate of return to both men for winning the last presidential election that.

While thanking Nigerians who supported him during the election, he said &ldquo;The hard work to deliver a better Nigeria continues, building on the foundations of peace, rule of law and opportunities for all. We will roll up our sleeves afresh, and give it our all. We have no other motive than to serve Nigeria with our hearts and might, and build a nation which we and generations to come can be proud of&rdquo;.
&ldquo;I can assure that you will see a country moving to the Next Level, as we consolidate on our fundamental areas of securing the country, reviving the economy, and fighting corruption. Many other focal areas, as stated in our campaign manual, will be added, to the good things we plan for our country.
While supporters who had gathered at the ICC cheered the winning team, particularly, the president, many Nigerians spread across the country booed to express their displeasure with the outcome of the election. They had obviously gone to the polls, expecting a different result- a change in government.
The PDP itself had accused the ruling APC of colluding with the leadership of INEC to manipulate the process. But the election is over and unlike what people expected, he is back again to power. What then are Nigerians saying about the second coming of president Buhari.
Nwafor Ndubuisi, 53 said he went to the polls on 23rd February, hoping that Abubakar- candidate of the PDP- will emerge the next president of the country so he can change the narrative in the country. But he became gobsmacked when the results were announced.

Ndubuisi was surprised with the outcome of the polls
&ldquo;It was completely beyond the expectation of Nigerians because president Buhari does not deserve another term giving his poor performance in the last four years. He left the country worse than he me it"" he said.
He blamed the victory of Buhari at the polls on the INEC.
&ldquo;I am not completely though surprised because our electoral system in this country is highly corrupt. Those in charge of the election decided to rig the process in the favour of Buhari because he is the one in power&rdquo;.
He described the reemergence of Buhari as an anathema and the worst thing that could ever happen. &ldquo;I expect a worse situation that we find ourselves in at the moment because he does not have the interest of the masses at heart. Look at the killings going on in the country. Look at the high rate of corruption in government offices. Yet, he cannot do anything. I don&rsquo;t expect anything good from him at all. As a country, we have not progressed at all and we will not even progress under him again&rdquo;. He said.
Like Ndubuisi, Favour Faith, 48 said she was not happy when she heard that Buhari is coming back again because he did not deliver on his promises of change that heralded his victory in the 2015 election.
&ldquo;We expected that something different would happen with Atiku as the president. Unfortunately, we have our incumbent president back again. I know that the process was not free and fair as it ought to be&rdquo;.

Faith says she is not happy that Buhari is back again
She however said he hopes that things will get better this time.
&ldquo;President Buhari must remember his promise to Nigerians and strive to bring a positive change. He must remember that posterity will remember him for everything, both good and bad he does&rdquo; she said.
Abubakar takes case in court 
After the presidential election results were announced and Buhari returned as winner by the INEC, candidate of the PDP Abubakar rejected the result, claiming that they were manipulated in the favour of Buhari and that he was rigged out by the INEC.
Following the announcement of his disapproval of the election results, he filed a legal suit against the INEC, demanding that he be allowed to inspect the electoral materials used by the commission for the conduct of the February, 23rd election. His request was granted by the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal, PEPT.
2015 election in a bit
The 2015 presidential election was won by Buhari, not only because all the 15 million Nigerians who voted believed in him, but because they just wanted former president Goodluck Jonathan voted out by all means.
Many Nigerians came hard on him for not taking Boko Haramseriouslyand it was thought that Buhari would be better positioned to defeat the militants and bring back peace, given his military antecedents.
In the words of former president Olusegun Obasanjo before the election in 2015 &ldquo;anybody except Jonathan&rdquo; would do. This drove many to vote president Buhari, giving him victory in his fourth attempt at the presidency.
Four years after he assumed office, Buhari struggled to live up to the high expectations that greeted his victory in 2015. Till now, the challenge of insecurity has persisted. Insurgents&rsquo; attacks have even become more vicious than ever.
It was thought that Nigerians, in a movereminiscent to the 2015 election, will vote out another incumbent over the growing disaffection in the land. But after the election, the story is different.
And now, he is back again to the helm of affairs. Nigerians can only wait and watch him for the next four years."

&ldquo;The issue of herdsmen has the potential of engulfing this nation but fortunately, our dear governor was appointed as the co-chairman of the national technical committee that made a recommendation to the federal government on how to resolve the crisis between herdsmen and farmers.
&ldquo;The recommendation made by the committee helped to reposition thefocus of the Federal government on how they wanted to handle the issueof farmers/ herdsmen and ranching in Nigeria.
&ldquo;That is why in Ebonyi, we have not had such crisis that is between farmers and herdsmen that would go national. We also have the right and the latitude to take any of the herders to court to protect the interest of the indigenous farmers but this is a state where people live together as one.
&ldquo;This is a state where the interest of the herders is protected, a state where we encourage foreigners to live in peace with others.

He said the ruling party will ensure that all the leadership positions in the National Assembly including chairmen of committees, except the ones that are statutorily reserved for opposition, are occupied by APC members.
Oshiomhole who spoke on Monday at an interactive session with newly elected members in the House of Representatives at the Yar&rsquo;Adua Centre in Abuja said the APC was aware of the clandestine meetings already being held by the PDP to plot how to infiltrate APC ranks for pecuniary gains.
He said the APC national leadership is determined to checkmate any such attempt by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to apply the tactics it used in 2015 to pick up plum positions in the National Assembly.
&ldquo;We will not share power in the House of Representatives and the leadership must ensure that critical committees that drive government are chaired only by APC members. If the Nigerian people wanted PDP to be chairmen of committees they would have voted for them,&rdquo; he said.
Oshiomhole said in the 9th National Assembly, APC will not allow disunity amongst its members, adding that &ldquo;PDP and other minority parties can have their say but working together, APC must have it way in legislative agenda, in the leadership of the National Assembly and the leadership of the committees in the National Assembly&rdquo;.

&ldquo;So all the chairmen of committees, except one that is statutory reserve for opposition , which is Public Account, they can have that. So, we would not do the kind of thing that happened the last time in which some APC members as members of the leading party became distance spectators in the management of committees, when PDP had majority of the strategic committees in the House, that will not happen in the next Assembly.
We are aware that they believe tbey can use the divide and rule by sponsoring many people within our ranks to contest for some of the positions so that they then become the king maker and in return the person will offer them some chairmanship seats. Honourable members and comrades, I am sure you are not going to do business with them. We will see them as partners in progress but in democracy the rule is, and it is a universal rule, majority must have their way but minority must be allowed to have their say,&rdquo; he said.
Out of the 223 members of the APC in the incoming House of Representatives, 164 are first timers, while 59 are reelected members.While urging the new legislators to support the party leadership, Oshiomhole said the National Working Committee is going to consult President Buhari as well as other party leaders in an effort to arrive at an appropriate zoning formula.

&ldquo;Somebody told me the opposition party people are already doing something, raising money to bribe people and I said, no, we are anti corruption, we cannot be corrupted. If they bring one billion naira to each member, PDP person will not be Speaker, a PDP person will not be Deputy Speaker, a PDP person will not be Whip, a PDP person will not be Leader and a PDP person will not take any of the Committees that are meant for the ruling party. We are determined to achieve that and be rest assured that the party will stand by you,&rdquo; he said.

He however noted that the president was able to manage the economy efficiently and because of that, there is an improvement in the infrastructural sector of the country, like construction of roads and maintenance of existing ones and even the waterways, all of which contribute to the growth of the economy.
&ldquo;This administration has done well in the three major areas which include: fight against corruption, improvement in the economy and security. It is easier to destroy than to build and so, it will take us time to get the country to the level that the president wants. This is why our campaign this time was on next level&rdquo;. He said.
On the exclusion of the South East zone from leadership positions at the National Assembly, Onu said that his Contact Committee was making every effort to ensure that the zone gets what rightfully belongs to her.

&ldquo;We believe that the national leadership is working to ensure that we all get fair share of whatever positions. So, you don&rsquo;t need to be worried. Instead, get motivated and encouraged to work harder to preserve the existence of our great party&rdquo; he said."

According to him, it was the turn of the South East because all the other regions have taken their turns to lead the country.
Nwala noted that the zoning formula which was fought for to ensure that every region occupied the office of the President in the country have been messed up.
&ldquo;I was in the 1993/94 constitutional conference, the first time that zoning was raised. I was one of those that fought for it,&rdquo; he told Sun.
&ldquo;The idea was to move the presidency round among the six geo-political zones &ndash; North and South alternation.
&ldquo;The presidency goes to one zone in the North and next time to another zone in the South until it goes round among the six political zones, but you can see that they have messed it up.
&ldquo;The North has no business asking for presidency in 2023, as the presidency should go to the South. In the South, the Southwest should not look towards that direction as Obasanjo has taken their turn. In the same way, the South-south, as Jonathan has taken their turn.
&ldquo;It is the turn of the Southeast. But the problem is that if we are not united to decide who should represent us, you find out that they will from long range pick a candidate for us.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy with what happened in the last election, the Igbo voted as one people, as they voted for Atiku and Obi. If we sustain this, when 2023 comes, we should be able to determine who will be there for us.
&ldquo;As things stand now, at the constitutional conference, we were able to forge a national alliance that will make the hegemony take the back seat as minority.
&ldquo;As things are now, if there is no rigging and the field is left open, there will be a pattern of voting &ndash; majority of Southwest, majority in the South-South, majority in Igbo land, majority in Southern Kaduna, majority in the Middle Belt, the Talakawas in the North all of them will vote as one people.
&ldquo;What is important for us as Igbo is to try and hold ourselves together as a people; president or no president, let us hold ourselves as one people, fight for our own internal autonomy. If we do that they will be looking for us. By right and if things are done correctly, 2023 has to be the turn of the Igbo.

&rdquo;In addition to the capital,Yola, the towns of Michika, Madagali and Mubi which had been occupied by Boko Haram during their military advances have since been retaken by the Nigerian military&rdquo; he said.
According to him, the military personnel are also clearing litters of Boko Haram&rsquo;s carnage and are, through the support of the administration as well as local and international partners, rebuilding roads and bridges, power lines, burnt schools, markets, destroyed churches and mosques.
&rdquo;Without an iota of doubt, the Northeast is better off with President Buhari than it was under the previous administration.
&rdquo;That should explain the massive turnout of voters in the region, in spite of threats to life and property, to vote for the return of the President for a Second Term of four years"" he said. &rdquo;Sadly, one of the realities of today&rsquo;s Nigeria is that it easy to blame President Buhari for the violence all around us,&rdquo; he added
Shehu condemned situations were community leaders were &rdquo;too scared to blame the warlords and the sponsors of killings&rdquo; because they fear for their own lives.
He said: &rdquo;What is happening in several communities racked by inter-ethnic and religious violence is arising from the refusal of community leaders to point at known criminals in their midst for the law enforcement agencies to act against them.
&rdquo;They rather blame President Buhari for their woes.
&rdquo;It is indeed an irony that in the week that Bishop Mamza was speaking, another Bishop with a known commitment to peace, and results to show for his work in neighbouring Plateau State, is being dispatched to go to Taraba, Adamawa and Benue to work in collaboration with security agencies in mending broken inter-communal relationships.&rdquo;
While sympathising with families of those who lost loved ones as well as those injured, Shehu said this senseless violence could never be condoned by the Buhari administration.
He added that the administration&rsquo;s intense security efforts and peace building would not only continue, &rdquo;but will expand in response to such explosions of violence in the country.&rdquo;"
428,"The Senate, Thursday confirmed the reappointment of Mr. Godwin Emefiele as governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for a second and final term of five years,Saying he performed creditably in his first term.
Emefiele&rsquo;s confirmation was sequel to the presentation of the report of the Senator Adebayo Ibrahim-led Senate Committee on Banks, Insurance and other Financial Institutions that screened him on Wednesday.
President Muhammadu Buhari had on May 8 submitted the name of Emefiele to the Senate for the renewal of his second and last five-year tenure as CBN governor.
The Senate at plenary on Tuesday referred the president&rsquo;s letter to the banking committee for further legislative action.The committee thereafter screened Emefiele on Wednesday and recommended him for re-appointment as CBN governor.Presenting the committee&rsquo;s report yesterday, Ibrahim said the committee took its time to screen the nominee.
According to him, &ldquo;The nominee made his presentation, which covered his experience in banking even before becoming the governor of the central bank.
&ldquo;On assumption of office as the governor of the central bank, he brought a number of initiatives which positively impacted on the Nigerian economy and boosted revenue generation through promotion and ensuring the adherence to accessibility and transparency of government finances.&rdquo;
He said in his first tenure as CBN governor, Emefiele was able to liquidate ailing financial institutions, bridging not too sound financial institutions and maintained stable interest rate and effective management of the nation&rsquo;s foreign exchange regime.Ibrahim added that Emefiele also initiated several policies and programmes, which have positive effect on the economy.
&ldquo;After scrutinizing him, at the end of the screening exercise the committee findings are as follows; that the nominee has more than 32 years of banking experience, that the nominee understands the diverse nature of the economy and has displayed profound knowledge of the continuous existence of the economy&rsquo;s stability.
&ldquo;That he has performed creditably well in his first tenure which resulted to the exit of the nation out of recession. Going by the nominee&rsquo;s character, banking experience, vast economic knowledge and performance in his first tenure, he is qualified for the position of the Governor of the Central Bank for another tenure for which he has been nominated by the president.&rdquo;
The Committee Chairman thereafter moved a motion to the effect that &ldquo;based on the foregoing, the committee recommends that the Senate should approve the renewal of the appointment of Mr. Godwin Emefiele as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
The motion was seconded by Senator Chukwuka Utazi who described the report of the committee as well researched and well written.
Speaking during the confirmation, the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, charged him to use his re-appointment for another five years to help improve the nation&rsquo;s economy.
He advised the CBN boss to deploy his wealth of financial experience towards the economic revitalisation of Nigeria.Saraki also admonished him to use the renewal of his appointment as an opportunity to continue to provide support and ensure the economy of the country is improved upon to address the most important areas of ensuring micro economic policies.
Saraki thereafter congratulated Emefiele on his re-appointment, saying: &ldquo;On behalf of the Senate let me congratulate the Governor of the CBN on the renewal of his appointment for another term of five years.&rdquo;
Emefiele Challenges Suit Seeking to Stop Senate&rsquo;s Confirmation
Despite his clearance by the Senate, Emefiele has challenged the suit seeking to stop the confirmation of his re-appointment by the lawmakers.
The suit, which was initiated by Mr. George Uboh under the auspices of the Incorporated Trustees of George Uboh Whistleblowers Network, is praying the Federal High Court in Abuja to stop the Senate from taking any step to screen and confirm the re-appointment as CBN governor pending the hearing and determination of a separate suit.
In reaction to the suit, Emefiele through his lawyers, Prof. Konyinsola Ajayi (SAN); Mr. Damian Dodo (SAN); and Prof. Fabian Ajogwu (SAN), filed court processes challenging the suit.
In the court papers obtained by the media, Emefiele dismissed all the allegations made by Uboh and his association as utter falsehood, frivolous, baseless and an exercise in bad faith.
In one of the court papers titled: &lsquo;Notice of Preliminary Objection&rsquo;, Emefiele argued that Uboh&rsquo;s case was predicated on mere suspicion and fabricated allegations, incapable of invoking the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.
He further contended that Uboh not only lacked the locus to institute the suit but that the entire suit was an abuse of court process.At the time of filing in this report, no date has been fixed to hear the objection."
429,"The Director General of Voice of Nigeria, VON, Osita Okechukwu, has said that the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in the presidential election will guarantee uninterrupted development in the country's critical infrastructure.
Okechukwu also condemned some of the organizations in the South East that adopted the candidate of the Peoples Democratic party, (PDP) Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in the election, insisting that it was the case of putting the Igbo votes nearly into one basket.
Speaking in Enugu during a party organised by the Buhari Support Organisation/Zikist Buharist Movement to celebrate the victory of Buhari in the polls, he said that the president's victory will provide a lifeline to ongoing development of critical infrastructure, such as roads, rail and massive investment in agriculture, geared towards diversification of the country&rsquo;s economic base.
He recalled that Buhari's administration embarked on the provision of additional 5,000 megawatts of electricity, 5,000 kilometers of federal roads and 5,000 kilometers standard gauge rail lines of critical infrastructure shortly after he assumed office in 2015 not minding the economic downturn.
He however blamed the poor performance of Buhari in the South East on what he described as bigotry orchestrated by the Chief Nnia Nwodo faction of Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) who deceived the people with Atiku&rsquo;s phantom restructuring gimmick.
He said it was appalling how the organizations placed more premium on restructuring more than Nigeria president of Igbo extraction in 2023, adding that 2023 is more pragmatic and reasonable than opaque restructuring posted by Atiku in pages 152 and 153 of AtikuPlan.
He explained that Nigeria has a rigid constitution and for anybody to restructure the country, it will require two thirds approval by the National Assembly and the 36 states legislative assemblies.

430,"President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the current tide of kidnappings, banditry and other violent crimes across the country would soon be a thing of the past.
The president stated this whilde delivering his Easter messageon Thursday in Abuja
While admitting that the country is currently passing through trying times, the president assured that the killers would be defeated ultimately, adding that the security agencies had been given the necessary support to end the killings.
The president also felicitated with Christians and urged them to use the auspicious season to show love to neighbours, and cater to the needs of the less-privileged.
According to him, Our nation is currently gripped with gloom over unfortunate killings, kidnappings and violence, as seen in the recent tragic incidents in some states of the federation.


He said &ldquo;This should not be. We must reinforce the bond of brotherhood and good neighbourliness that citizens of a cohesive country must share. We must not allow the few bad elements in our communities to put asunder our communal tendencies and chords of unity.


&ldquo;I know from my regular interactions with security chiefs, state governors, victims and members of communities caught up in the unfortunate cycle of violence, that Nigerians are united against the evil minority.
Continuing, he said ""This administration will do all it takes to adequately equip and motivate our armed forces and other law enforcement agencies to enable them successfully confront these security challenges. We will not allow merchants of evil and death to overwhelm the nation"".

431,"The leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abia North Senatorial District- South East Nigeria has told senator-elect, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu of the All Progressives Congress, (APC) that he can&rsquo;t get away with what it termed &ldquo;a stolen mandate&rdquo;.
The PDP made their stand known on Friday during a solidarity visit to the incumbent Senator, Chief Mao Ohuabunwa to pledge their unflinching support in his bid to recover his &ldquo;stolen mandate.&rdquo;
Abia North Zonal Chairman of PDP, Hon Matthew Ibe, said that the PDP as one united family would stop at nothing until &ldquo;the people&rsquo;s mandate given to our candidate but forcefully stolen by APC is returned &ldquo;.
The former lawmaker expressed shock that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, issued certificate of return to Kalu &ldquo;even when he was never returned nor declared the winner of the Abia North senatorial contest by the Returning officer&rdquo;.
He urged INEC to withdraw Kalu&rsquo;s certificate of return and organise re-run election in all the polling units and wards where votes were canceled.
&ldquo;This is the height of impunity and rascality for a man who was never returned in an election to be issued with the certificate of return.\
&ldquo;Kalu only scored the highest number of votes by fraudulently allocating figures to himself but still at that, the 10,000 votes margin of win remains a far cry from the over 38,000 total number of canceled votes.
&ldquo;It is only a question of time and our candidate&rsquo;s stolen mandate will be restored &ldquo;, he said.
The PDP Zonal Chairman urged other successful candidates of the party including Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu and his Deputy Ude Oko Chukwu not to abandon the senator but relentlessly sustain their support until his mandate is restored.
Responding, Ohuabunwa thanked the delegation for their solidarity, expressing faith that he would get justice at the tribunal.
He said the position of the law and INEC guideline on the principle of the margin of win was very clear, and &ldquo;unambiguously makes it illegal&rdquo; for a candidate to be returned in an election if the margin of win is less than the number of canceled votes.
Ohuabunwa said &ldquo;Kalu knows that what he has is a stolen mandate which he will soon surrender. He knows the truth but only thinks he can play smart but unfortunately for him, we are resolute in reclaiming the people&rsquo;s mandate.&rdquo;"

Wickremesinghe, told the media thathe was &ldquo;out of the loop&rdquo; when it came to intelligence warnings on the deadly Easter Sunday bombings.
Speaking on Wednesday on the series of suicide bombings which killed at least 359 people, the Sri Lankan minister, Lakshman Kiriella said that Some top intelligence officials hid the intelligence information purposefully. "" Information was there, but the top brass security officials did not take appropriate actions"" he said.
He also revealed that details on probable suicide attacks on churches, hotels and politicians were received from Indian intelligence on April 4 and a Security Council meeting was led by President Maithripala Sirisena on April 7, but the information was not shared on a larger scale.

&ldquo;Somebody is controlling these top intelligence officials,&rdquo; the minister said. &ldquo;The Security Council is doing politics. We need to investigate into this.&rdquo;
However, Wickremesinghe said that crucial information about any potential danger in the country was not passed to him.
The country&rsquo;s police chief and top defence ministry official have both resigned over the bombings, however Wickremesinghe argued the fact that he was unaware of the warnings meant he did not need to step down from his position.
&ldquo;If we had any inkling, and we had not taken action, I would have handed in my resignation immediately,&rdquo; he said, adding: &ldquo;But what do you do when you are out of the loop?&rdquo;"

435,"President Muhammadu Buhari has departed the country for lesser hajj in Saudi Arabia.
Lesser hajj, popularly known as &ldquo;umrah&rdquo; in the Muslim community, is an optional but recommended pilgrimage to Makkah that can be made at any time of the year.
The aircraft conveying the president and members of his entourage took-off from the airport around 11am on Thursday.
Buhari&rsquo;s trip followed his invitation by Salman Bin Abdulaziz, king of Saudi Arabia and custodian of the two holy mosques.
Garba Shehu, senior special assistant on media and publicity, had earlier confirmed that Buhari would perform lesser hajj while in the Kingdom.
Among those who bade the president farewell at the airport were Abba Kyari, his chief of staff; Mohammed Bello, minister of the federal capital territory (FCT); and Muhammed Adamu, acting inspector general of police.
The last &lsquo;umrah&rsquo; Buhari performed was in February 2016.
"
436,"The National chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, has said that there is no government in Nigeria.
The chairman also criticized the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration&rsquo;s approach to handling security issues in the country.
While addressing newsmen in Abuja on Friday, Secondus questioned the existence of a government in the country, stating that Buhari&rsquo;s incompetence in the handling of governance is taking a huge toll on the nation.
The PDP chairman noted that the security situation in the country has become continued source of concern among prominent Nigerians, including clerics and monarchs.
He therefore urged the President to seek quality advice on the security challenges.
&ldquo;While the Presidency continues to argue that there exists government in our country today, what obtains in reality is different,&rdquo; he said.
Speaking further, he said &ldquo;The level of bloodletting occasioned by the barrage of criminalities across the country can only be happening in a country without government. &ldquo;Things got even worse as the remaining goodwill of the people on this government vanished after it arm-twisted the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), into tampering with the will of the people in the February 23 Presidential and National Assembly Elections.
&ldquo;There is no evidence of the presence of government in this country as crimes of all kinds are being committed all over the country and Nigerians have never lived in such great fear and trembling for their lives.
&ldquo;From Kaduna to Zamfara, Benue to Taraba, Plateau, Lagos to Enugu etc., bloodletting is continuing unabated. Even the President&rsquo;s home state of Katsina has lost about eight local government areas to bandits, not to talk of the North East.
&ldquo;Everyone holding public office must know that one day, they will be held accountable for their actions.&rdquo;
Secondus condemned the incessant killings in Kaduna State, where a British humanitarian aid worker, Faye Mooney and others were shot dead by gunmen last week.
He blamed the heightened insecurity in Kaduna on what he described as &ldquo;provocative leadership&rdquo; existing in the state and which he said, is indirectly being encouraged by the Federal Government.
&ldquo;The situation has deteriorated to the extent that this country can no longer protect the lives of international aid workers who are here to help us clear our mess.
&ldquo;The senseless continuous bloodletting in Kaduna state should be blamed on the type of provocative leadership existing in that state and indirectly encouraged by the federal government.
&ldquo;The &lsquo;body bag&rsquo; governor in the state does not seem to know how to engender peace among the people, his actions and utterances facilitate, instead of ameliorating the ill feelings among the people,&rdquo; Secondus said.
Furthermore, Secondus alleged that the Federal Government has been exerting energies and resources planning nefariously how to undermine democratic institutions.
He said, &ldquo;After its several attempts to hijack the legislature failed, it turned to the Judiciary ridiculing the revered third arm of the government to the point of removing their confidence.
&ldquo;The executive backed humiliation of the head of the Judiciary, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen is a well-designed strategy by the APC administration to intimidate and coerce judicial officers, particularly the Judges and Justices to fall in line and endorse all their undemocratic behaviours that are bound to come to the judiciary for adjudication.
&ldquo;My advice to members of the Judiciary, particularly those handling election matters and who are all Nigerians and who are also living in Nigeria is that the country and rule of law should guide all their actions.
&ldquo;They should know that providence has placed in their laps the opportunity to make positive history and enshrine justice and fair play in our society, knowing as a fact that no nation grows on injustice and injustice breed crisis&rdquo;."

According to the union, workers would have no option than to embark an industrial action should the governors delay in paying.
This warning was handed down by the Anambra State Chairman of the NLC, Jerry Nnubia during the quadrennial delegate conference of the congress in the state, advising governors to cut the cost of governance by reducing some of their excesses to enable them to implement the new minimum wage.
Nnubia further called on the governors not to do anything capable of causing unrest among Nigerian workers, adding that the full implementation of the N30,000 monthly minimum wage would ensure stability in the polity.
He said: &ldquo;The minimum wage bill is a product of negotiation and with President Muhammadu Buhari signing it into law. We are looking out for a circular to be released and each state is bound to implement it. The state governments have no option but to implement it because they were part and parcel of all the negotiations.
&ldquo;For us in Anambra State, we have the firm belief that our governor will implement it fully. He has promised us and I am sure we are not going to have challenges in that regard.
&ldquo;We commend the National Assembly for the speedy passage of the New National Minimum Wage (2019) Amendment Bill and also President Muhammadu Buhari for assenting to it on April 18, 2019.
&ldquo;We, therefore, wish to use this platform to call on the National Salaries, Income and Wages Commission, to immediately release the implementation table to enable our hard-working and labour-friendly governor, Chief Willie Obiano, who has already firmly promised to be the first governor to pay the new minimum wage to the hard-working workers of Anambra State, to implement the new minimum wage.&rdquo;"
443,"A political activist and former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Timi Frank has asked the Senate to withhold the confirmation of Mr. Godwin Emefiele for second term as the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) over the leaked audio exposing missing N500 billion under his watch. 
Frank said it would amount to disservice to the Nation if Emefiele is confirmed by the red chamber without the public knowing how such a huge of amount of money disappeared from the treasury.
 The Bayelsa born activist was reacting on Monday to an audio published on Sunday by an online medium, Sahara Reporters. Frank said in recent times, the media has been awashed with so many revelations concerning the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, ranging from the role he played in the money &lsquo;illegally&lsquo; approved for a former National Security Adviser (NSA), Col. Sambo Dasuki to the recent revelation by Dr George Uboh-led Whistleblowers Network, where it was alleged that $2.5billion dissapered under his watch.He said: &ldquo;Emefiele must come clean on this audio as well as other issues as it bothers on alleged corrupt practices under his watch. I am happy with the dispatch with which the CBN responded to the leaked audio conversation. 
&ldquo;However, I did not expect anything less than the denial. It is trite that &lsquo;one can not be a judge in his own case&rsquo;. Therefore, Let the relevant agencies of government as well as the National Assembly investigate these allegations with great in-depth. 
&ldquo;If the CBN is saying the beginning part of the conversation was omitted, can they provide Nigerians with the full and authentic audio conversation in the interest of transparency and good governance. 
&ldquo;I implore the CBN governor to defend these allegations by himself as he remains a public servant and therefore, answerable to the Nigerian people. Anything short of this will amount to covering up. 
&ldquo;I hereby, call on the Senate to stand for Nigeria as they have always done. 
The Senate must not play with the mandate of Nigerians by attempting to confirm Emefiele in the face of this damning allegations. Any attempt to do that will amount to the Senate being complicit on the matter. 
&ldquo;However, having stood firm in the non-confirmation of Ibrahim Magu of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), based on the report from a security agency, I have no doubt that the Senate will do the right thing in this instance. &ldquo;I also call on the EFCC to quickly act on these revelations as they have done in the case of Saraki, the president of the Senate by inviting Emefiele to explain his role in the leaked audio as well as other allegations against him that are now in public domain. 
&ldquo;If all these figures and amount is confirmed, it will be the mother of all corruption in recent times. &ldquo;I implore the EFCC to approach this particular case the same way they are approaching Saraki&rsquo;s case. 
Where properties that were subject of litigation upto the Supreme Court level (where Saraki was discharged and acquitted) are being investigated all over again. &ldquo;Par-adventure, the EFCC fails to investigate the case at hand, it will become clear that the anti corruption war is merely a witch hunt on the opposition. &ldquo;
Let me use this medium to call on the President and the Vice President in particular, who is in the habit of accusing the previous government of massive corruption, to act swiftly on all these allegations and show that he is a true vanguard of anti corruption drive. 
&ldquo;I hope the President, on his part, will not defend Emefiele as he did in the case of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State. &ldquo;I implore the President to withdraw Emefiele&rsquo;s nomination to allow for an in-depth investigation of the allegations against the CBN boss. 
&ldquo;Nigerians and members of the international community are watching how this classical case of alleged corrupt practices will be handled.&rdquo;"
444,"As expected, the outcome of the presidential election in Nigeria has continued to generate controversies, expecially in the camp of the major opposition party, the People's Democratic Party. The party's candidate has decided to go to court to challenge the outcome of the polls.
Atiku insisted that the election was completely mared by gross irregularities ochestrated in other to bring back the government of President Buhari. He said that the process was not at all free and fair as formally agreed.
According to him, ""in my democratic struggles for the past three decades, I have never seen our democracy so debased as it was on Saturday, February 23, 2019. The 2007 was a challenge, but the then President Umaru Musa Yar&rsquo;Adua was remorseful. In 2019, it is sad to see those who trampled on democracy thumping their noses down on the Nigerian people,&rdquo;
In other to tackle the issue headon, members of the National Peace Committee including former head of state, Gen.

The presidency has also reacted to Atiku's decision to go to court. It said it was not threatened by the decision of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, to challenge President Muhammadu Buhari&rsquo;s victory in last Saturday&rsquo;s election in court.
Making this submission while answering questions from State House correspondents, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, said Atiku&rsquo;s decision to contest the victory of Buhari in the court is lawful and hence, the PDP candidate is free to satisfy his intention.
He insisted that both the country&rsquo;s constitution and the Electoral Act provide that whoever is not satisfied with the results of any election can seek a redress in the court.
He dismissed the insinuation that APC leadership was jittery, claiming that the electoral process was transparent, adding that by his decision to contest the victory of the All Progressives Congress in court, Atiku is only obeying the laws.
&ldquo;We are not jittery at all because the process was open and transparent. It was a credible election and we will continue to savour in the victory but in the process too, we will extend the hand of friendship for the purpose of nation building and reconciliation.
&ldquo;Our electoral Act and the constitution have both provided a window for whoever is dissatisfied with the process of election to seek redress. That is the path and we will encourage them to go along that path,&rdquo; Mustapha said."
445,"A total of 42 candidates will contest for the governorship position in one of Nigeria's South East states of Enugu on Saturday, March 9th.
Confirming the number of the candidatesduring a daily Media/Stakeholders Update on the ""2019 Gubernatorial/State Assembly Election in the state, the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Emeka Ononamadu, also said that over 310 candidates will run in the state Assembly election.
Ononamadu also announced that adequate plans have been made by INEC in the state to conduct a credible election and forstall the challenges that were witnessed in the last presidential and National Assembly election.
""We will ensure that the whole 4145 pillow units spread across the state will be open on time to enable voters come out early and vote"".
He said that the whole sensitive materials for the election are currently at the Central Bank of Nigeria [CBN], Enugu for safe-keep.
According to him, ""We have recorded 100 per cent completion of smart card reader configuration and charging, now ready for deployment to council areas and Registration Area Centres"".
He said that INEC in the state would begin sorting of available sensitive materials at the CBN on Tuesday, March 5 and this would be done in the presence of party agents, election observers and security.

446,"The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has said President Muhammadu Buhari must come clean about his academic qualifications.
The PDP and Atiku said in the petition filed at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT) in response to Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) claim that the former vice president was not qualified to run for the president.
In the reply filed by Livy Uzoukwu (SAN), the PDP and Atiku argued that, having failed to attach the credentials to the Form CF001, which he submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Buhari lied that his certificates were with the Nigerian Army.
They challenged Buhari, the incumbent President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, to direct the Nigerian Army to make his credentials public, if indeed, they actually exist.
Their response read: &ldquo;In further response to paragraph 381(iv) of the 2nd respondent&rsquo;s reply, aver that the petitioners have no knowledge of any certificates or alleged qualifications issued to the 2nd respondent (Buhari), but contend that 2nd respondent falsely represented that his certificates are in the custody of the Nigerian Army when the 2nd respondent, by his own admission, is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria.
&ldquo;In further response to Paragraph 381(iv) of the 2nd respondent&rsquo;s reply, the petitioners aver that the 2nd respondent as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria could easily order the Army Secretary to produce the certificates allegedly submitted if they actually exist.
&ldquo;Contrary to paragraph 381(i-iv) of the 2nd respondent&rsquo;s reply, the petitioners aver that the 2nd respondent does not posses the educational qualification he claimed to have in his INEC Form CF001 submitted to the 1st respondent (INEC) having not been attached as required.
&ldquo;In reply to the paragraph 383 of the 2nd respondent&rsquo;s reply, the petitioners aver that the 1st petitioner (Atiku) is eminently qualified to contest election for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and had indeed attached evidence of his educational qualifications to his INEC Form CF001 submitted to the 1st respondent, unlike the 2nd respondent (Buhari) who did not attach evidence of the qualifications he claimed in his INEC Form CF001 because he does not possess them as he falsely claimed.
&ldquo;The purported training and courses&rdquo; which Buhari had claimed placed him &ldquo;head and shoulders&rdquo; above Atiku in respect to educational qualification to contest the presidential election, &ldquo;did not culminate in the issuance of any certificates he claimed in his INEC Form CF001.&rdquo;"
447,"President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the redepoyment of 71 staff of the State House Aso Villa, Abuja, ahead of his inauguration for a second term in office.
A circular from the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation (OHSOF), revealed that a total of 71 staff on SGL 07-14, both security and civil servants were affected.
The circular signed by the Director, Employee Mobility, M. S. Naibi, in the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation, said all handing and taking over processes should be completed on or before Friday May 3.
The staff affected are to comply, failure of which they might face sanctions.
&ldquo;Any disregard of this deployment shall be treated in accordance with the provision of PSR 030301(b),&rdquo; the circular stated.
The affected staff have been redeployed to the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation (OHSOF) and some designated ministries."
448,"Ahead of the reschedule presidential and National Assembly elections that are to hold on the 23rd of February, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has released the final breakdown of Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) collected by eligible voters.
The country electoral commission announced its decision to shift the date for the election just five hours before voting time, citing logistics reasons and its determination to conduct free, fair and credible elections.
But the body has since assured Nigerians of its readiness to conduct the election general elections after they were shifted.
The INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu announced that a total of 72.8 million PVCs have been collected across the country as at February 11. He made the disclosure while speaking at the daily INEC briefing in Abuja.
The breakdown presented showed that Lagos State leads with a total of 5.5 million (5,531389) PVCs collected, followed by Kano which has a total of 4.7 million (4,696,747) PVCs collected.
The two states are followed by Kaduna which has 3.6 million (3,648,831) PVCs collected, Katsina which has 3.2 million (3,187,988) PVCs collected and Rivers with 2.83 million PVCs collected.
The states with the least number of collected PVCs are Ebonyi (666,591), Bayelsa (769,509) and Kwara (1,149,969).
The total number of PVCs collected in each state is a reflection of the maximum numbers of votes that can be got in the state as only registered voters with PVCs are eligible to vote.
But results from previous elections have shown that having higher registered voters or PVCs does not mean having more people coming out to cast their votes especially giving the fact that voters can collect their PVCs and decide not to show up at the polls.
The four states with the highest number of PVCs collected are said to be battleground states for the candidates of the APC and the PDP in the presidential election, political analysts believe.
These four states are also controlled by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Apart from Governor Akinwumi Ambode of Lagos State, the governors of the other three (Kano, Kaduna and Katsina) are also seeking re-election on the APC platform.
The general election is set to commence on Saturday, February 23, with presidential and National Assembly elections while the governorship and house of assembly elections will hold on March 9.

449,"No fewer than 116 officers in specialized units within the Enugu State Police Command are currently undergoing human rights training in order to ensure efficient service delivery.
The officers undergoing the training were drawn from; the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), Anti-Cultism Unit, (ACU), Special Anti-Terrorism Squad, (SATS) IGP&rsquo;s monitoring team and a host of other specialized units
Declaring the three-day training open, the acting Inspector General of Police (IG), Mohammed Adamu, said that the training was intended to improve the professionalism of officers of the units.
Adamu, who was represented by the Commissioner of Police in-charge of Training, Mr Abiodun Odude, said that the training was part of a holistic reform to get personnel of the police and other units well equipped to discharge their duties with every sense of responsibility.
He said that the police have zero tolerance for human rights abuses and will not fail to sanction any officer found to have abused people&rsquo;s human right and rubbished the professional integrity of the Nigeria Police.
&ldquo;This is why the Nigeria Police is partnering with reputable organizations to bring the training down to command and unit levels so that all can learn and those with bad orientation can change for good,&rdquo; he said.
Earlier in her address, the Executive-Director of Prisoners&rsquo; Rehabilitation and Welfare Action (PRAWA), Dr. Uju Agomoh, said that the purpose of the programme is to help build the knowledge and skills of the SARS and other special units in Enugu State in terms of their compliance to human rights issues.
Agomoh, whose organization is providing technical support for the training, noted that it was not enough to call for banning of certain units; rather, there was a need totrain, retrain and support them to get the best.
She regretted that part of the problems confronting the SARS for instance, is the fact that people are sent to the unit without proper pre-training. So they only have the normal general training.
&ldquo;We cannot say that SARS should be crucified without ensuring that they are not provided with the necessary skills and capacity. That is not being fair. I think that there are a lot of things that are wrong with different agencies and the solution is not to cancel them&rdquo; she said.
Speaking further, she said &ldquo;we all know that attitudes take time to change. And that is why we are trying to provide the necessary support to make it easier. This training tries to discover root causes of human rights abuses in the police and tackle them&rdquo;.
On his part, country Project Manager of Deutsche Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ). Mr Hartmut Zander, said that GIZ had been sponsoring reforms and trainings in the Nigeria Police through its &lsquo;Police Programme Africa&rsquo;, which has run for over three years.
Zander, who was represented by Amokeye Agim, said that GIZ aims at ensuring holistic reforms in the Nigerian police and ensuring that it performs its functions as well as promote international best practices in policing within Nigeria and Africa at large.
&ldquo;We have been supporting the Nigerian police force through training their trainers because we believe that when the trainers are well equipped to give training to the officers, then the quality of training that these officers get definitely improves&rdquo; she said.
On his part, the State Commissioner of Police, Mr Sulaiman Balarabe, thanked the IG for approving that the officers in the command partake in the intensive training meant to reposition them for efficiency and good relations with members of the public.
&ldquo;I sincerely believe that at the end of this training and other follow up trainings, our officers will increase their knowledge of human rights which will in turn make our crime fighting approach effective and people-oriented,&rdquo; he said.

450,"President Muhammadu Buhari has intervened in the case of a young Nigerian girl, Miss Zainab Aliyu, recently arrested in Saudi Arabia for alleged drug offence, the presidency revealed on Monday.
A statement by a Presidential Aide, Mrs. Abike Dabirir-Erewa, in Abuja, said that the President had directed the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami, to immediately act on the case of Zainab, the student, incriminated in drug related matters, being detained by the Saudi Arabia authorities, when the matter was brought to his attention recently.
&ldquo;President Muhammadu Buhari gave the directive immediately the matter was brought to his attention about two weeks ago. My office has been working with the AGF as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in that regard&rdquo;, Dabiri-Erewa revealed.
The Presidential aide assured that progress was being made in Zainab case, along with two others in similar circumstances in Saudi Arabia.
Dabiri Erewa said that Zainab, though detained, has not been put on trial by the Saudi Arabia government, saying that with the hard evidence that those who implicated her had been arrested, a strong legal case is being made to the Saudi authorities
Mr Habib Aliyu, the father of the alleged drug courier, had appealed to the federal government of Nigeria, the Saudi authorities and the international community, as well as well-meaning individuals to intervene in her daughter&rsquo;s case and save the &lsquo;&rsquo;innocent&rsquo;&rsquo; lady from being executed wrongly.
Habibu Aliyu, Kano based senior editor, who is not happy that his daughter is cooling off in a Saudi Prison, despite the recent discovery that she was framed up by some drug cartel, explained that the allegations of Zainab entering the country with Tramadol, was absolute falsehood as recent events and arrests have confirmed the girl&rsquo;s innocence.
Zainab, a student of Maitama Sule University, Kano, had travelled from Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA) in company of her mother, Mrs. Maryam Aliyu, and sister, Hajara Aliyu.
She was later arrested over allegations that a luggage, bearing her name tag, contained the unlawful substance.
Zainab who was accused of entering Saudi Arabia with an illegal dosage of Tramadol was later discovered to be a victim of a cartel that specialises in keeping hard drugs in travellers&rsquo; bags, some of whom are already in the custody of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency."
451,"The Sultan of Sokoto and President General of the Jama&rsquo;atu Nasril Islam (JNI), Alhaji Muhammad Abubakar Sa&rsquo;ad III, has called for commitment and proactive steps to address the challenges bedeviling the country.
Speaking yesterday at the opening session of the JNI Central Council Meeting and Annual Pre-Ramadan Conference in Kaduna, the Sultan maintained that the challenges have been in the increase because necessary steps and commitment to implement solutions identified were not taken.
The conference was organised to provide the Islamic solutions to the menace of poverty, insecurity and the influence of drug abuse in the Muslim society.
According to him, &ldquo;The challenges bedeviling the country require commitment and proactive steps to address them.
&ldquo;These challenges have unfortunately been on the increase because necessary steps and commitment to implement solutions identified are not taken.&rdquo;
He said the meeting would discuss issues affecting the Muslim Ummah and some national issues affecting the society as well as proffer the way forward.
The Islamic monarch called for prayers for the souls of those who have been killed as a result of the security challenges in Nigeria, noting that death is inevitable for all, as he added that everybody would be accountable someday to God for their actions.
&ldquo;As human, we cannot run away from death but our activities here on earth is what will stand for us on the day of judgement,&rdquo; he added.

We are so specially privileged and so enormously fortunate that our people choose us among so many other millions to lead them. 
Speaking further, he said &ldquo;This tremendous privilege which leadership thrusts upon us also comes with grave responsibilities. Those responsibilities are multiplied by the fact that most of our people are extremely poor.Large numbers are unable to afford good healthcare and malnutrition remains a major problem. Children in many of our States run the risk of being permanently mentally stunted because they are malnourished,&rdquo;.

President Nana Akufo-Addo has since accepted Bukari&rsquo;s resignation and wished him well, the Communications Director at the Presidency, Mr. Eugene Arhin, said.The embattled former minister, who was the Minister of the Upper East Region at that time, was captured on tape attempting to bribe a journalist to stop him from publishing disparaging reports on Shaanxi Mining Company and a judge in 2018. 
Bukari had initially debunked the claim.The Presidency said Bukari submitted his letter of resignation to the President on Monday 29th April, because he had&rdquo; taken note of the tape circulating in the media, &ldquo;and had, therefore, taken the decision to resign &ldquo;In order not to allow the tape to disrupt the focus of the government in delivering on its mandate."
454,"The Minister of Works, Power and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, yesterday attributed the slow pace of ongoing infrastructural projects in the country to lack of funding. He was speaking at the closing ceremony of a four-day workshop programme for federal controllers (Housing) in Ilorin, Kwara State.&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard about funding, you&rsquo;ve heard the minister of Finance and then the National Assembly. You&rsquo;ve heard everybody saying we are borrowing too much, you&rsquo;ve everyone saying that the money is going to capital projects. ""You&rsquo;ve heard everybody saying we need to increase our revenue base and look at so many things and some people disagree. So, we have to find consensus where to find money. It&rsquo;s money"" the minister said.
Speaking futher, he said &ldquo;The major problem we have with infrastructure generally is regular funding and sustained funding. So, those who say we should not borrow should find alternative answer to where we get the money. 
Those who don&rsquo;t support borrowing are they ready for increased taxes? On the one hand, they are saying that in order to drive the economy, government must reduce taxes or corporate taxes or individual taxes. It&rsquo;s a chicken and egg thing really. Where do we get the money? 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not from president Buhari salary or NASS salary.We are talking of quantifiable substantial amount of billions of naira, hundreds of billions of naira to spend to pay because that&rsquo;s how you move money round an economy,&rdquo; he said. 
He dismissed insinuations that Nigeria had 20 million housing deficit. Fashola said the ministry had removed the mandatory 10 percent equity contribution before accessing loan from the National Housing Funds. 
He also stated that before the privatization, the ministry of power had over 50,000 staff, but now, 779."
455,"Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, has denied claims the Nigerian government offered to pay Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) N100 billion as a part of efforts to end kidnapping in the country.
While speaking with journalists in Abuja, shortly after a closed-door session with the Senate, Adamu said such measures were unnecessary in tackling kidnapping in the country.
Following a meeting between the IGP and the leadership of the Miyetti Allah, reports had emerged on social media, claiming that the federal government was planning to appease MACBAN with N100 billion to set up cattle ranches for their livestock.
However, Adamu said the social media report was the figment of somebody&rsquo;s imagination, framed up to distract attention.
&ldquo;There was nothing like that. That information you got was social media information.
It has nothing to do&hellip; there was no any discussion to that effect.
&ldquo;The source of the information, nobody knows; and certainly it is not from government.
&ldquo;It is somebody&rsquo;s imagination that just came up to distract attention,&rsquo;&rsquo; Adamu said."
456,"ConservativeMPs on both sides of theBrexitdivide are tellingTheresa Maythat afresh referendumis becoming &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo;, as talks withLabourto break the impasse looked set to fail.
The prime minister faced the warning as shesuffered the embarrassment of concedingthis month&rsquo;sEuropean electionswill go ahead &ndash; and as her own deputy suggested the crisis would drag on until July.
As cross-party talks entered their sixth week, Labour&rsquo;sKeir Starmerinsisted he would force the Tories to end their refusal to contemplate aFinal Sayreferendum as the price of a deal, saying it was &ldquo;crunch time&rdquo;.
Significantly, the attempt to put a public vote centre-stage was bolstered from an unlikely source whenDaniel Kawczynski, a ToryBrexiteer, predicted it could become the only option &ldquo;to break the gridlock&rdquo;.
&ldquo;If we cannot do this, if this is beyond us, and if we fail, then another referendum is inevitable,&rdquo; he said, expressing gloom about a deal otherwise.
Ed Vaizey, a pro-EU Conservative, echoed Mr Kawczynski, saying he was &ldquo;warming to the idea&rdquo; of a second vote as potentially &ldquo;the only way to finally have closure on Brexit&rdquo;.
The comments came as multiple Labour sources toldThe Independentthere could be no deal without a referendum, a demand now being made by around two-thirds of the party&rsquo;s MPs, it is understood.


Last Friday,Eric Pickles, a former party chairman, become the most prominentConservative supporter of a referendum, when he gave his surprise backing.




The calls came as talks between Labour and the government broke up without agreement, with both teams preparing to meet again on Wednesday afternoon.
After the three-hour meeting, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary,said:""Discussions today were very robust and we're having further meetings this week where we hope to make some progress.""
She said there was a ""willingness on both sides"" to work together butthere had been no movement towards a customs union, temporary or otherwise.
Ms Long-Baileywould only say another referendum was ""one of many options on the table"".
Meanwhile,David Lidington, the de-facto deputy prime minister, bowed to the inevitable, by admittingthe government had run out of time to stop the European elections, on 23 May, with no ratification of Brexit in sight.
He paved the way for what is expected to be a Tory drubbing byNigel Farage&rsquo;s newBrexit Party, by finally admitting: &ldquo;Legally, they do have to take place.&rdquo;
Mr Lidington appeared to set a new deadline for ratifying a deal before MPs leave Westminster for their summer break in late July &ndash; which would mean MEPs taking their seats at the start of July.
&ldquo;Ideally, we&rsquo;d like to be in a situation where those MEPs never actually have to take their seat atEuropean parliament&ndash;certainly, to get this done and dusted by the summer recess,&rdquo; he said.
No 10 played down the significance of the comment, insisting Mr Lidington had merely been &ldquo;stressing the importance of having this process completed before MPs rise for summer&rdquo;.
The elections will cost around &pound;150m. To avoid further costs, the withdrawal agreement bill will need to be put before MPs within a week or so &ndash; but that will not happen without a Labour agreement not to vote it down.
At the weekend, the acrimony was laid bare whenJohn McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and other Labour figures accused Ms May of refusing to budge on the party&rsquo;s central demand for a permanentcustoms union.
Heading into the talks, Sir Keir, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: &ldquo;The time has now come to a crunch time, where the government has to decide whether it&rsquo;s serious about significant changes capable of actually carrying a majority in the House of Commons.&rdquo;
He pointed significantly to the clamour over a further referendum, adding: &ldquo;A confirmatory vote will also be on the agenda, and we&rsquo;re going to discuss that this afternoon.&rdquo;
No 10 has refused to provide &ldquo;a checklist&rdquo; of her continued red lines in the talks, but her own MPs made clear the referendum issue could no longer be dodged.
&ldquo;If there can be no compromise between the parties, I can actually see then the logic, and other people will be demanding another referendum,&rdquo; Mr Kawczynski added.
Mr Vaizey, a former minister, said: &ldquo;I've always been against asecond referendum. But I think what is changing my mind is this talk about any agreement reached by parliament being seen as illegitimate.&rdquo;

Any cross-party deal would pass only narrowly, which means MPs would &ldquo;spend their whole time telling the public that this isn't Brexit, it&rsquo;s not the Brexit they voted for &ndash; it's illegitimate&rdquo;.
Earlier, the prime minister metGraham Brady, the head of the1922 Committeeof Tory backbenchers, who was expected to again urge her to set a rapid timetable for her departure.
If she refuses, the 1922 will consider rewriting the rules to allow a fresh vote of no confidence this summer &ndash; but Sir Graham made no immediate comment on Ms May&rsquo;s response.
Asked about the EU elections, the prime minister&rsquo;s spokesman said she &ldquo;deeply regrets&rdquo; the fact the UK would be taking part, admitting: &ldquo;Many members of the public will feel great frustration at this.&rdquo;
The spokesman declined to say whether Ms May thought people should vote in the elections &ndash; or whether she would take part in any election campaign launch by the Conservatives.

459,"The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to end his private visit abroad, return to Nigeria and face the worsening security situation in the country. 
The PDP in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said it was wrong for Buhari to be abroad while bandits, marauders and insurgents maim, kidnap and kill innocent citizens with reckless abandon.The PDP said Buhari had not demonstrated the required capacity to control the security situation, alleging that he had now resorted to cheap escapism, particularly in the face of allegations in the public space that certain individuals around his administration were benefitting from the situation. 
&ldquo;President Buhari&rsquo;s inattention has emboldened insurgents and bandits to continue to over-run communities, unleash mayhem and bloodletting on citizens in Borno, Zamfara, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe Taraba, Kaduna, Benue, Kogi and other states of the federation, including Mr. President&rsquo;shome state, Katsina,&rdquo; the statement said.&ldquo;While President Buhari wanders abroad, bandits are having a field day, pillaging communities in Katsina state; killing several persons and abducting the District Head of his hometown, Daura, Musa Umar; the father in-law of Mr. President&rsquo;s security aide. 
&ldquo;Within this period, marauders invaded communities in Adamawa and killed no fewer than 26 innocent Nigerians; many more have been killed in Borno, Taraba, Benue and Zamfara states, where bandits also reportedly attacked Government Girls Secondary School Moriki, and kidnapped some school girls,&rdquo; the statement added."
460,"Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, has asked that President Muhammadu Buhari and other top holders of public offices be barred from foreign trips until the insecurity in the country is resolved.
Falana, while presenting a paper on press freedom in Nigeria and the rule of law, said the president and all governors should be barred by Nigerians from embarking on foreign private or official visits to other countries until further notice.
The President is currently on a 10-day private visit to the United Kingdom and is expected to return to Nigeria on May 5, 2019.
Falana, had earlier criticised Buhari&rsquo;s visit to the UK, describing it as illegal.
He said: &ldquo;The President is not permitted by the constitution to abandon the enormous responsibilities of his office for 10 days on account of a private visit to the United Kingdom or any other country whatsoever.&rdquo;
During the paper presentation, the senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN) attributed the root cause of insecurity to poverty, adding that the menace cannot be curbed outside Nigeria.
&ldquo;It is high time President Buhari and all state governors who are abroad returned to the country to attend to the urgent crisis of insecurity,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;With the virtual take-over of the country by armed bandits, terrorists and kidnappers, the president and all top public officers should be barred by Nigerians from embarking on foreign private or official visits to other countries until further notice.
&ldquo;It is common knowledge that the security challenges facing the nation include terrorism, kidnapping, armed robbery, human trafficking and extra-judicial killings. As the root cause of such violent crimes is traceable to the excruciating poverty in the land, a critical examination of the security challenges cannot be undertaken outside the nation&rsquo;s neo-colonial capitalist political economy.&rdquo;
Commenting on the role of the media, Falana said the constitution has charged members of the fourth estate of the realm to hold public officers accountable.
He advised the press to shun putting light on the certificate controversy of politicians but nudge them to provide solutions to underlying issues of poverty and underdevelopment.
&ldquo;In Nigeria, no attempt has been made to repeal any of the repressive media laws while the national assembly has been trying frantically to censor the media and use the pending press council to gag the media,&rdquo; Falana said.
&ldquo;All elected public officers should be made to proffer solutions to the crisis of underdevelopment and stop the irrelevant debate on the educational qualification of any candidate.
&ldquo;Since the 2019 elections have been concluded the duty imposed on the media is to ensure that political parties and elected officials are held accountable.
He also called for a review of the concept and understanding of the rule of law among politicians.
&ldquo;While senior public officers continue to give the impression that the country is operated under the rule of law their actions and utterances suggest otherwise. In the process, the country is reduced to a banana republic where the rule of law is substituted for the rule of the rulers,&rdquo; he said."
461,"In its bid to brng to an end the ragging crisis between herdsmen and farmers, the Federal government said it has begun the process to create a radio station for herdsmen in the country.
The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu on Wednesday, in an interview with newsmen in Abuja, confirmed the development, saying the Federal Government already obtained Amplitude Modulation radio broadcast licence to reach herdsmen across various locations in the country.
He said the development will also enhance the measures to promote nomadic education, adding that the establishment of the radio frequency would end the persistent farmers-herders clashes.
The minister revealed that the station which will operate on a frequency of 720KHz, would be aired in Fulani language, as the government believed the radio medium was one of the viable means to reach the herdsmen.
His words; &ldquo;The radio service will serve as a vehicle for social mobilisation and education, in addition to interactive radio instruction methodology that will be adopted to reach the very hard-to-reach segment of our target population.
&ldquo;Additionally, it will enhance our capacity to address the crisis between herders and farmers with attendant consequences to loss of lives, destruction of productive assets, nomadic schools, facilities teaching and learning resources.&rdquo;

462,"Clashes between opposition supporters and Venezuela&rsquo;s armed forces in Caracas left a woman dead and 46 people injured on Wednesday.
This came in after Venezuelans heeded opposition leader Juan Guaido&rsquo;s call to take to the streets on Wednesday to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro from power, but there was no tangible sign of change in a crisis that gradually looks like a political stand-off.
According tomedia reports,there was gunfire in the city, and a local NGO, the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict, said Jurubith Rausseo, 27, had been shot dead during a rally in the opposition stronghold of Altamira.
However, pressure seems to be drilling between the US and Russia over the crisis.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US may take military action to resolve the crisis, and accused Russia and Cuba for strike at the foundations of the country through their support for Mr Maduro.
The US also empasized its support for Mr Guaid&oacute; while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Mr Pompeo that America&rsquo;s influence over Venezuela was damaging and an abuse of international law."
463,"Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has suggested that the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other opposition party leaders in Nigeria are ignoramus when it comes to playing opposition politics.
He has therefore asked them to understudy their counterparts in Venezuela and Sudan to get knowledge on how real opposition leaders are meant to play politics.
Venezuela, a country struggling with hunger and repression, has had sustained protest by the opposition in the country led by Juan Guaid&oacute;.
Only last April, opposition in Sudan apparently played a major role in the military ousting of the country&rsquo;s former President, Omar al-Bashir, after a three-decade rule.
Fani-Kayode, a chieftain of the PDP, who would want Nigeria&rsquo;s opposition parties follow the path of those two countries, said in a tweet on his official Twitter handle:
&ldquo;The ex-minister wrote, &ldquo;Go to Venezuela and Sudan and find out how real opposition leaders are meant to behave when faced with mass murder, genocide, ethnic cleansing, sit tight leaders, rigged elections, wholesale tyranny and barbarous and brutal injustice.
&ldquo;The opposition in Nigeria has much to learn.&rdquo;
PDP, which was thrown out of federal power in 2015, after leading the country for 16 years, remains Nigeria&rsquo;s major opposition party."
464,"Stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress, APC in Enugu have advised candidate of the party in the just concluded governorship election, Ayogu Eze to accept his defeat at the polls honorably.
They said that Eze who was defeated by incumbent governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of the PDP, did not have the right to shun an election as a candidate by the way and that the directive would have been better had it come from the National Working Committee, NWC of the Party.
In a communique made available to journalists on Tuesday, at the end of their meeting and read by Okosisi Chinedu, Zonal Vice chairman of the party in Enugu North, they stakeholders said that Eze does not have an option that to accept his ""self-inflicted"" humiliations and concede defeat honorably.
According to them, Eze went ahead to boycotted his election and equally ordered candidates of the party for the House of Assembly elections to also boycott their elections, all without knowledge of the NWC of the party.
They revealed that Eze also diverted the electoral fund giving to him from the national secretariat of the party and only released N100,000.00 each to the House of Assembly candidates in the State without the authorization of the NWC of the party.
They stated that Eze's action throughout the election period portrayed him as a betrayer and sellout to the party. ""We were not expecting a better result than what we already have&rdquo; they said.
They also came hard on Eze for failing to campaign before the election, insisting that the party would not have got votes at the polls but for the efforts of the Hon Minister of Foreign Affairs, who toured all the 17 Local Government Areas of Enugu State campaigning and canvassing for votes,
""Ayogu Eze came back from a self-imposed political exile only on the last day of campaigns stipulated by INEC. He never campaigned for one day"". One wonders the type of miracle he expected"" they stated.

465,"Presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, got a dose of caustic comments from former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, for comparing Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) with Afenifere and Ohanaeze Ndi Igbo socio-cultural groups.
Garba Shehu was reacting to comments by critics who said the government was talking with bandits following a meeting between the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu and the leadership of the Miyetti Allah, when he made the comparison.
He said; &ldquo;It is a mistake to say the Nigerian government is talking to bandits.
&ldquo;The Miyetti Allah group is like Ohanaeze and Afenifere. It is a socio-cultural group. There are criminals within the Yoruba race and you cannot say because of that, Afenifere is a group of criminals,&rdquo; Garba Shehu said.
However, Fani-Kayode in a series of tweets posted on his timeline blasted Garba Shehu saying Miyetti Allah is an umbrella organisation of dark, callous, bloodthirsty and merciless men that seek to legitimise, shield and protect the Fulani herdsmen.
Fani-Kayode wrote; &ldquo;No they are not. They are an association of butchers of cows and men. They are the purveyors of violence, the custodians of falsehood and the repositories of evil. They are as perfidious as they are dangerous!
&ldquo;They are an umbrella organisation of dark, callous, bloodthirsty and merciless men that seek to legitimise, shield and protect the Fulani herdsmen, the fourth most deadly terrorist organisation in the world.
&ldquo;Comparing them to Afenifere or Ohaneze is like comparing the Church of Satan and the Cosa Nostra to the Vatican and the Anglican Communion,&rdquo; he added."
481,"Igbo apex socio-cultural and political organization, Ohanaeze, has backed Pastor Tunde Bakare of the Latter Rain Assembly on his claim that Nigeria was under siege.
Bakare, while addressing his congregants during church service on Sunday, noted that terrorists, kidnappers and killer herdsmen were now in charge of Nigeria.
Media and Information Adviser to the President General of Ohanaeze, Emeka Attamah, told Vanguard that Bakare was &ldquo;right because terrorists are really in charge of whatever is happening now in Nigeria.
&ldquo;If terrorists are not in charge, why should officials of this government negotiate with leaders of Miyetti Allah who are demanding N100 billion to enable its members stop killing Nigerians?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I am not even sure that they have not paid the money. I would not like to be quoted as saying that all the officials of this government are terrorists but I never knew that Nigeria would descend to this level of open brigandage. It has never happened before.
&ldquo;There is nowhere in the world where the government is in tacit understanding with terrorist organisations.
&ldquo;Governments usually fight to eliminate terrorists and not to encourage them.
&ldquo;The Nigerian government should face terrorists and treat them as such and not to eat or dine with them,&rdquo; he said."
466,"Former president, Goodluck Jonathan, has insisted that he does not own any bank accounts or property abroad.
Jonathan stated this in a statement issued on Saturday by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, in reaction to a report that claimed that lawyers representing the Federal Government, in a London court filing, accused him of accepting bribes in order &ldquo;to broker a $1.3 billion oil deal eight years ago&rdquo;.
He dismissed the report on the controversial Malabu oil deal as a recycled falsehood that is blatantly dishonest, cheap and predictable.
&ldquo;Former President Goodluck Jonathan did not ask for or collect any bribes, neither has he been charged for asking or collecting bribes, neither will he ever be charged with asking for or collecting bribes, because such never happened.
&ldquo;That this particular dispute predated the Jonathan administration and survives it. That former President Jonathan is 61 years old and throughout his life has never opened an account, nor owned property outside Nigeria,&rdquo; he said.
The statement added, &ldquo;In fact, we expected something like this ever since it was announced that former President Jonathan would lead the Election Observation Mission of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa to South Africa&rsquo;s national and provincial elections.
&ldquo;We are well aware that this claim was intentioned to eclipse the goodwill and positive reports of former President Jonathan&rsquo;s diligent engagement in South Africa&rsquo;s national and provisional elections.
&ldquo;The fact that most major media houses in the country refused to republish this falsehood bears out our conviction that Nigerians can no longer be deceived by hollow and diversionary claims of corruption, in the face of worsening state of affairs in the country.
&ldquo;We have always made it clear that beyond this wave of conjecture, former President Jonathan was not linked, indicted or charged with collecting any monies as kickbacks or bribes from ENI by the Italian authorities or any other law enforcement body the world over.
&ldquo;It bears repeating that the documents relating to the transactions and decisions of the Federal Government on the Malabo issue, during the Jonathan administration, are in the relevant Government offices, where they are accessible.
&ldquo;We would like to point out that all the actions taken by the Jonathan administration in relation to activities in the oil industry were legally conducted by relevant Nigerian Government officials and were carried out in the best interest of the country.&rdquo;
The statement added that whether in office or out of office, former president Jonathan still &ldquo;does not own any bank account, business or real estate outside Nigeria&rdquo;."
467,"Enugu State Chief Judge, Priscilla Emehelu has said that the operations of the Special Anti- Robbery Squad, (SARS) must be guided by the human rights principles as enshrined in the constitution of Nigeria in order to meet up with international best practices.
Emehelu made this known at the opening ceremony of a two -day workshop on the provision of monitoring and support to the Special Anti- Robbery Squad, (SARS) in the state.
Emehelu who was represented by Justice A. O Anidi said that though substantial reformations have been undertaken by the Police hierarchy to address the numerous complaints and allegations of human rights abuses against SARS personnel, reformations have not well been observed as the incidents that led to the nationwide call for reformation still rear up their ugly heads.
Describing the workshop as important and timely, Anidi recalled that the then Acting president, Yemi Osibanjo gave a directive to the former Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris to ensure a total overhaul of the SARS.
She however regretted that some overzealous personnel have become dangerous to the society by their unprofessional and unlawful conducts of illegal detentions, torture, extra judicial killing and series of human rights abuses and have constituted a toxic climate of fear to the populace.
According to her, SARS is a special police unit created with specific mandate to prevent, confront and solve cases related to armed robbery, kidnapping and other violent crimes.
She said that the police must therefore strengthen their monitoring apparatus in combating these challenges of some unscrupulous elements in SARS.
&ldquo;Continuous assessment of operatives deployed to SARS must be regularly conducted to determine their suitability in keeping with acceptable standards&rdquo; she said.
Speaking further, she said &ldquo;It is not in doubt that the citizens will be better protected if the police are provided with the right equipment, good working conditions, training and all the necessary support they require&rdquo;.
On his part, the representative of the Deputy Inspector General, DIG in charge of Training and Development, Force Headquarters, Abiodun Odude, Oti Ademola said that officers of the NPF must be careful when going about their duties because the force is determined more than ever before to reward or punish any officer who defaults while discharging his/her duties.
&ldquo;Activities of the police force must be in line with democratic principles which strict compliance to human rights observance is part of and for they to be able to effectively perform this task, they must be equipped both theoretically and practically&rdquo; he said.
Speaking further, he said it is believed that lessons learnt in the workshop will be maximally put to use because it is when the usage is activated that the society can be proud of the police.
Earlier in her address, the Deputy Director of Prisoner&rsquo;s Rehabilitation and Welfare Actions, (PRAWA) Bar. Ogechi Ogu said that the training is part of efforts put in place to build the capacity of members of the Nigerian Police Force, SARS especially so that they can serve the country better as there was a reason why it was established.
According to her, building capacity of training institutions and members of various units will help in addressing issues of human rights and the standards as well as principles that are adequate for the police in the discharge of their duties.
&ldquo;It is hoped that at the end of this workshop, the NPF will be better equipped and more focused to tackle cases of human rights violations as well as armed robbery and other violent crimes.
Representing the Enugu State Commissioner of Police, Suleiman Balarabe, the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Haruna Alaba said that SARS, which is a part of the Nigerian Police Force, has the responsibility of dealing with violent crimes.
He however regretted that activities of certain members in the system in recent times, have damaged and rubbished its performance, leading to various calls by members of the public for the abolishment of the unit.
&ldquo;SARS have performed credibly well. Unfortunately, it has had its fair share of challenges. What is therefore needed is modification in its operations that will usher in a better service delivery to the nation&rdquo; he said.

In a report of their observations on the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections contained in a statement, YIAGA also expressed concerns on the immoral use of electoral guidelines on the collation of results.
In the statement issued by the Executive Director, YIAGA AFRICA, Samson Itodo, the observer group also cited cases of INEC officials instructing security agents to deny accredited observers access to results in collation centres.
According to the statement, &rdquo;the reports on non-compliance with electoral guidelines and procedures lapses in our electoral process could potentially undermine the integrity of elections. YIAGA AFRICA is concerned with the flagrant abuse of electoral guidelines on the collation of results in three states.

471,"Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, has revealed that the nation&rsquo;s foreign missions in Sri Lanka, Czech Republic and Republic of Serbia have been closed, while the mission in Ukraine was drastically downsized due to lack of funds.
While speaking, Tuesday in Abuja, on the activities of the ministry in the last three years, Onyeama noted that before the closure Nigeria had 119 foreign missions.
He said the reduction of Nigeria&rsquo;s foreign missions remains one of the agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.
Onyeama explained that the closure of the missions was occasioned by inability of the ministry to maintain them due to insufficient funds.
&ldquo;Every embassy has written to us about their huge financial demands and when we go to these embassies we see clearly very unattractive state that does not reflect well on the country.
&ldquo;Very often the staff of the embassy really find things extremely difficult.
&ldquo;Clearly, if we want to operate on the scale and scope in which we are at the moment with over a 100 missions around the world, we need to spend a lot more.
Also, the minister observed that although Nigeria has spent a lot, it was not enough, compared to what other countries around the world spend
&ldquo;What I am saying is that rather than having this terrible circle of inadequate funding for missions, headquarters and so forth we have to reduce the scope.
&ldquo;We should have foreign missions that we can fund, we might not necessarily close the embassies per se, it might be reducing the number of staff in the embassies.
&ldquo;Because what we found out is that it is more expensive to close the embassies than operating them,&rdquo; he said."

&ldquo;This visit is in line with the tradition of the COAS to pay homage to the executive governor of the state and assess the disposition of troops, and the security situation in the region,&rdquo; he said.
He noted that security situation in Katsina State recently escalated through the inimical activities of armed bandits but was curtailed by the gallant troops.

He said that operating a two or three party system would enable the electorate to pick their leaders objectively without bias or confusion.
According to him, the multi-party system operated in the country was a mere waste of the nation&rsquo;s resources.
&ldquo;We have 91 political parties in the country presently which are all funded by the government; this is outright waste of our nation&rsquo;s resources.
&ldquo;I will advise we streamline these parties to two or three to guide against confusion on which party to put in power and manage our resources well,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.
Ariole urged FG to be fully responsible and responsive to the needs of Nigerians which included health, housing, education and food.

Arising from their meeting at the APC office in Ekeh, the ward executives affirmed their confidence in the VON DG whom they described as a consistent and principled member of the party whose contributions to its growth in the state is unequaled.
The affirmation was contained in a resolution released after the meeting which wassigned by the chairman, Nze Philip Ogechukwu and other 26 members of the ward executive.
The resolution read in part: &ldquo;The All Progressives Congress (APC) Eke ward in Udi L.G.A, Enugu State, at its ward meeting held on Sunday, 3rd March 2019 notes with dismay, disbelief, disappointment and disapproval, the news of the suspension of Mr. Osita Okechukwu, the DG VON, by the National Working Committee (NWC) of our great Party for alleged anti-party activities.
&ldquo;The APC, Eke Ward also notes and states that Mr. Osita Okechukwu is not only a registered member of the APC, Eke Ward, but also the major life wire of the APC who has nursed the party both in Eke Ward, Udi L.G.A and Enugu State in general.
&ldquo;The APC, Eke Ward, further states that there was no report of Anti-party activities against Mr. Osita Okechukwu presented to the ward Executive nor did the ward Executive or any member of the ward make any report of anti-party activities against Mr. Osita Okechukwu to any other higher organ of the party either at the Local Government, State or Federal levels.
&ldquo;The APC, Eke ward, further states that we have asked our major sustainer, Mr. OsitaOkechukwu, whether he was queried or confronted with any allegation/complaint and he said no, therefore we are at a loss as to how a foundation member and member of the merger committee that midwifed our great party can be suspended without fair hearing.
The ward urged the National Working Committee (NWC) to immediately rescind the suspension as it created the impression that the reward for nursing the party in Enugu State was suspension.
The party also stressed the need to follow due process as clearly stipulated in the APC Constitution in disciplining any member of the party, as the rule of law and due process are the bedrocks of liberal democracy.
Okechukwu had earlier dismissed what he described as a purported suspension, insisting that there was no fair hearing and that he was neither written nor invited before the suspension.

502,"Theresa May has announced she is standing down as Prime minister on Friday June 7.
The Prime Minister met the leader of backbench Conservatives, Sir Graham Brady, on Friday to discuss her future after her authority was left in tatters following the backlash against her new Brexit deal.
Media reportsrevealed that the Prime Minister would step down amid intensifying pressure from Conservative members of Parliament, many of whom have been agitating for her to leave office after her failure to deliver a Brexit deal that could satisfy her party.
May&rsquo;s days were numbered after concessions made to opposition politicians over her Brexit deal failed to win support among opponents, and left her own allies feeling betrayed.
A crop of candidates is already filing to take over as Conservative leader and become the next prime minister, including Boris Johnson, May&rsquo;s former foreign secretary. Other former and present members of May&rsquo;s cabinet are also expected to compete."

Onnoghen approached the appellate court to have his trial and conviction for lack of declaration of assets by the Code of Conduct Tribunal, CCT, voided.
Onnoghen, who was suspended from office by President Muhammadu Buhari on the order of the CCT, also prayed the Court of Appeal to declare the order for his suspension null and void.
The former CJN, who resigned from office shortly before his conviction, is praying the Appeal Court to void the order of the tribunal for the forfeiture of the monies in the disputed accounts.
It would be recalled that the Federal Government had, through the Code of Conduct Bureau, CCB, dragged Onnoghen before the CCT, alleging that the former CJN failed to declare or properly declare his assets.
The Mr. Danladi Umar-led three-man panel tribunal said it was satisfied that the FG successfully proved its allegation that Onnoghen acted in breach of the code of conduct for public officers in the country.
It also held that evidence of three witnesses that testified in the course of the trial were not discredited by the defendant who was accused of failing to properly declare his assets, as well as operating five domiciliary foreign bank accounts.
According to the tribunal, the admission by the embattled former CJN that he forgot to declare the five accounts he operated since 2009, was &ldquo;weighty enough&rdquo; to guarantee his conviction."

She disclosed on Saturday during a town hall meeting she organized in Yola, the Adamawa state capital in collaboration with Concerned Indigenes of the state.
Aisha explained that the university would be established in collaboration with partners from Sudan and Qatar.
She regretted that the education as well as other sectors in the state have faced series of challenges, calling for active support of the state indigenes in complementing government efforts.
According to her &ldquo;I cannot conclude without suggesting how we can complement the efforts of government in achieving some of its developmental goals. &ldquo;On this note, I would like to advocate for the establishment of Adamawa Development Trust Fund through which prioritised developmental projects can be financed and implemented"".
Others who spoke during the meeting include Prof. Shehu Iya of Modibbo Adama University, Yola, who spoke on education; Prof. Auwal Abubakar of Federal Medical Centre, Yola, who spoke on health; and Mrs. Helen Mathias who spoke on women and youths.
The meeting was also attended by politicians, particularly APC, PDP and ADC members in the state."
478,"A group, Yoruba Youth Forum (YYF) has backed former President Olusegun Obasanjo on his claim that Boko Haram and Fulani herdsmen are on a mission to Islamise and &lsquo;Fulanize&rsquo; Nigeria.
The group argued that instead of vilifying Obasanjo and accusing him of ethnic bigotry, that Nigerians should ask the current government about its agenda for security.
Obasanjo&rsquo;s recent claim that Boko Haram and marauding Fulani herdsmen were out to Islamize and Fulanize Nigeria and the entire West Africa at an event in Delta State, has continued to generate controversies with some Nigerians attacking him while others think he might not be wrong.
Adding its voice on the controversy, YYF in a statement on Tuesday signed by its president, Abiodun Bolarinwa, frowned at those attacking Obasanjo, noting that the former president&rsquo;s claim was a wake-up call to Nigerians.
Further arguing that President Muhammadu Buhari had performed below expectations in the area of security, YYF said:
&ldquo;Nigerians are not strangers in their fatherland and that is why the former President condemned the present administration for not providing adequate security for Nigerians.
&ldquo;Maybe we need to ask the government about its agenda for security because the silence on its part to the clarion call by the former President shows that the government is handling the issues of insecurity with levity.
&ldquo;The insecurity in Nigeria has been on for so long but it is now getting worse on a daily basis. The killings and kidnappings that are ravaging the nation are sending a wrong signal to innocent Nigerians and the outside world.
&ldquo;It is just unfortunate that the President is partisan in fighting the perpetrators of the crime because as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, his duty is to ensure the safety of lives and property of his citizenry.&rdquo;"
479,"The Hope Democratic Party, HDP, has appealed to the Presidential Election Tribunal to restrain President Muhammadu Buhari from his inauguration on May 29.
HDP made the appeal in a motion filed before the tribunal which is also seeking an order restraining the Chief Justice of Nigeria from swearing-in, administering the oath of office and oath of allegiance to the president on May 29th, 2019.
In a motion on notice made available to journalists on Tuesday, the party filed the motion on 6 grounds pursuant to section 1 subsection 2 of the 1999 constitution as amended and under the jurisdiction of the tribunal.
The party stated that there was a pending petition challenging the election and return of President Buhari as the winner of the February 23rd presidential election.
HDP said the petition has been served on President Buhari and pleadings have been exchanged.
It claimed that despite that the matter is still pending, Buhari has been making frantic preparation for his inauguration on May 29, 2019.
HDP stated that unless President Buhari was restrained from presenting himself for inauguration, he will foil &rdquo;a fiat accompli and state of hopelessness on the court and render their petition nugatory.&rdquo;
It insisted that the law says that once a question of the validity of an election of any person is challenged, that person is not competent to take an oath of office or assume the seat of power."
480,"The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has said that it would soon commence the prosecution of electoral offenders whose case files have already been prepared by the Nigerian Police. 
The INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu said this on Tuesday in Abuja during a meeting with stakeholders from Bayelsa State.He also acknowledged a proposal from the Bayelsa State Government for a shift of the November 2 governorship election. INEC had fixed November 2 later this year for the off-cycle governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states.The Bayelsa State Governor, Mr. Seriake Dickson, represented by his deputy, Rear Admiral Gboribiogha John Jonah (rtd), led the delegation. He pleaded for change of date, saying that the day clashes with its yearly thanksgiving service.

558,"The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday described the European Union (EU) report on the 2019 general election as a vindication of theperception that the February 23 presidential election was rigged to favour President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC).
The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the revelations of manipulations as detailed in the EU report further validated queries by Nigerians that Buhari was not validly returned for a second term in office.
&ldquo;The world can now see that the PDP has not been crying wolf in insisting that the election was rigged with the cancellation of millions of PDP votes, alteration of results and allocation of fictitious votes to the APC.
&ldquo;Nigerians are still in shock over the revelations by EU of how about 2.8 million votes were deliberately &ldquo;cancelled without sufficient accountability&rdquo; and how several returning officers gave no reason for the cancellations.
&ldquo;More shocking is the iniquity committed at the national collation centre, headed by the INEC chairman, where the EU report exposed inconsistent numbers, distortions and a large discrepancy of 1.66 million more registered voters, as announced by INEC on 14 January, compared to those announced by state returning officers during the collation of presidential results,&rdquo; the main opposition party stated.
PDP added that Nigerians witnessed on national television how professors and returning officers were unable to reconcile result figures due to heavy manipulations upon which INEC declared the APC winner.
It said the EU report had further exposed the iniquity committed by the Prof. Mahmood Yakubu-led INEC by listing how ballot boxes were compromised, how essential materials were missing, how voter register was not always ticked as required and how manual authentication procedures were not correctly followed.
&ldquo;The report also bared how figures on result forms did not reconcile, how result forms were not publicly posted, how result forms and smart card readers were not packed in tamper-evident envelopes as required, in addition to how the APC administration used security forces to intimidate voters, aid violence against our members and muscled votes for the APC,&rdquo; the opposition party added.
The PDP commended the EU for the courage in exposing the evils committed by the APC and INEC in the 2019 general election, saying the report has further reinforced the confidence of millions of Nigerians in their collective expectation of justice in the quest to retrieve our stolen presidential mandate at the tribunal.
The PDP said those in INEC who perpetrated such crime against thenation, in sabotaging the sanctity of our electoral processes to frustrate the choice of Nigerians in a presidential election, must be brought to book and made to face the wrath of the law.
It urged Nigerians to remain calm as the truth about the election continues to unfold while justice takes its course on the matter."
482,"The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) yesterday restated the loyalty of the Armed Forces to the 1999 Constitution as amended and President Muhammadu Buhari, dissociating the military from the circulation of a document, calling for the overthrow of the democratically elected government of the president.
In a statement by the Deputy Director of Defence Information, Navy Captain Muhammed Wabi, the DHQ accused a group, &ldquo;Nigerian Continuity and Progress (NCP),&rsquo;&rsquo; as being behind the document.
Wabi alleged that the document called for the setting up of an &ldquo;interim government&rsquo;&rsquo; in place of the elected government.
It said: &ldquo;The Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) wishes to dissociate itself from the rascality and intentions as espoused in a document being circulated by a faceless group named Nigerian Continuity and Progress (NCP), calling for support of a revolution to oust the current democratically elected government and in its place establish an illegitimate interim government.
&ldquo;The AFN out rightly condemns the undemocratic and demonic actions of the author of the document.
&ldquo;Accordingly, members of the public are enjoined to discountenance the content of the documents being circulated by NCP and equally condemned in totality, the call to derail our hard earned democracy.&rsquo;&rsquo;
The statement added that the armed forces was &ldquo;very mindful of its constitutional responsibilities&rsquo;&rsquo; and would not be misled into any act that would undermine democracy as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution as amended.
&ldquo;The AFN remains unflinchingly loyal to the Constitution, as well as President Muhammadu Buhari and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,&rdquo; the DHQ said.
The statement said all relevant law enforcement agencies had been advised to unravel those behind the seditious document for appropriate actions."
483,"The national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu has declared that President Muhammadu Buhari deserves commendation for declaring June 12 as Democracy Day.
Tinubu also thumbed up the move by the Federal Executive Council to move the second term inauguration ceremonies to June 12 while a low-key ceremony would be held on May 29.
In a statement by the Bola Tinubu Media Office, on Tuesday, signed by Tunde Rahman, Tinubu said President Buhari and the Federal Government deserved commendation.
He said: &ldquo;President Buhari deserves our thanks and congratulations for taking another important step towards fully recognising June 12 as Democracy Day in our country.
&ldquo;The government moved the second term inauguration ceremonies to June 12 while events on May 29 would now be low-key swearing ceremonies in order to comply with the constitutional requirements covering the length of term for elected office-holders.
&ldquo;By this wise, yet visionary decision, the president has scored double: first, he has accorded respect to the constitution, which recognises May 29 as the date to inaugurate new terms of office while at the same time, ensuring the country moves on the rightful path to formalising June 12 as new Democracy Day.
This decision soundly balances current legal requirements with the quest for political justice.
&ldquo;For this feat in moving the country in the right direction, President Buhari and the Federal Government deserve commendation.
&ldquo;June 12 represents an important milestone in the annals of Nigeria&rsquo;s democratic journey. It was the day Nigerians shunned ethnicity and religion to vote for that leader of their choice in an election adjudged clearly free and fair.
&ldquo;To complete this process, that the president has started via Executive Order, we hope that the National Assembly Act with reasonable dispatch in cooperation with the presidency to assure the requisite constitutional amendments are enacted to fully establish June 12 as Democracy Day.
&ldquo;As Nigerians, we have a role to play: rededicate ourselves to democracy, peaceful co-existence, togetherness and the hope for a greater future, all of which June 12 represented,&rdquo; the statement added."
484,"Nigerian Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Tukur Buratai, on Thursday claimed that Boko Haram, which has been terrorizing the North East of the country, has been defeated.
He said the Nigerian Army has defeated the insurgence group to a level they &ldquo;will never come again as Boko Haram&rdquo;.
According to him, reports of attacks still occurring in North East is coming fromIslamic State of West African Province(ISWAP), which he said is a group of international criminal organizations that are only trying make use of openings created by the breakdown of law and order in some neighbouring countries to perpetrate criminality in the West African sub-region.
Buratai stated this when he played host to several school children in Abuja, who visited him to learn more about a book written in his honour, &ldquo;The Legend of Buratai&rdquo;. The book was presented to the public on May 17.
The Army chief, however, assured that like Boko Haram has been supposedly pushed out of the North East, ISWAP will also be flushed out of the troubled region.
Buratai&rsquo;s claim is coming as President Muhammadu Buhari&rsquo;s spokesman, Garba Shehu, recently said that he cannot say if Boko Haram will ever be totally flushed out of Nigeria.
Meanwhile, when asked about his office and how he copes with its pressures, Buratai said, &ldquo;When I was appointed the Chief of Army Staff, I had the feeling that I will be the least controversial COAS. I had the feeling I will have an excellent relationship with the media. This first thing I did was to call the then Director of Army Public Relations and I told him that henceforth, all our actions and activities must be reported and made known to the media.
&ldquo;They had a right to know. It is the Nigerian Army. There should be no gaps about information in our operations in the North East or elsewhere. Before then, we used to have so many reporters in the north east including informants for the terrorists who plant stories and breaking news some of which went contrary to happenings, with a ploy to make troops unstable or demoralized.
&ldquo;So we started reporting events and occurrence about the battle, attacks in the northeast. We were breaking the news ourselves but this time, the real actions on the ground, not fabrications.
&ldquo;We also commenced interaction with stakeholders for them to see and know the true happenings, which later opened their eyes to appreciate what we were going through and the heroic efforts of troops. We interacted with the NBA, Human Rights Groups, the Media, &amp; others and they now understood our job better.
&ldquo;I also took personal steps to ensure troops fitness and agility particularly on the battlefield by issuing orders for officers and soldiers to trim down.
&ldquo;We also had pressures from International Organizations including Amnesty International who also found fault in anything we do.
&ldquo;I believe they have a hidden agenda which is best known to them by reporting falsehood against Nigerian military But by and large we set up investigation teams and found out the allegations they made were fabricated.&rdquo;
Some of the schools who paid the army chief the visit include White Plain British Schools, Abuja, EFAB International School, Gifted Hunira Arcade, Command Children School Mogadishu, Command Day Secondary School, Lungi, and Command Secondary School Suleija (Boarding)."

Last month, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he would ""sail to Canada and dump their garbage there.""
Reports say the waste amounts to many dozens of containers filled with common household rubbish like soiled nappies.
Philippine secretary of foreign affairs, Teddy Locsin said in a tweet that at midnight, last night letters for the recall of the ambassador and consuls to Canada went out. He said Canada missed the deadline and they shall maintain a diminished diplomatic presence in Canada until its garbage is ship bound there.
Locsin said what triggered him to pull out the envoys was Canada's failure to show up at a meeting with Philippine customs officials."

Recall that the Enugu State Command of the Nigeria Police had in the wake of the news report on social media, denied that no such incident occurred, explaining that after a preliminary investigation, it was discovered that what transpired was &ldquo;only the movement of cattle and herders from Cross River State through Uburu in Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi State and a neighboring town for grazing"".

488,"The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has knocked political parties for not submitting details of their financial transactions during the 2019 general election, including material contributions received from individuals and corporate bodies.
INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said yesterday in Abuja at a meeting with leaders of political parties to review the conduct of the general election that it was regrettable that none of the political parties had submitted its financial records, three months after the announcement of the results of the general election as provided for in Electoral Act 2010 as amended.
He, therefore, directed the parties that participated in the general election to submit immediately their financial records for the election as well as audited accounts of their parties after the election.
But the National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, faulted INEC&rsquo;s position, saying as far as the opposition party is concerned, the election is not over yet as the party is still at the tribunal.INEC said the submission of the financial records must contain details of financial contributions by individuals and corporate bodies.The electoral commission also charged the political parties to make early preparations for the Kogi and Bayelsa State governorship elections slated for November 16 to avoid late-minute rush.
Yakubu said: &ldquo;I wish to remind you that the Electoral Act 2010, as amended, requires each political party to submit two election expenses reports to the commission. First is the disclosure of material contributions received from individuals and corporate bodies three months after the announcement of the results of the general election as provided for in Section 93(4) of the Electoral Act. So far, no political party is in compliance.
&ldquo;Secondly, parties are required to submit audited returns of their election expenses within six months after an election as provided for in Section 92(3) [a] of the Electoral Act. Although we are still within the timeframe provided by law, so far only one party has filed its returns. Similarly, the commission notes that only one presidential candidate has submitted financial expenses report. We wish to remind leaders of political parties of their obligations under the law.&rdquo;
Responding to the allegation by INEC that the parties have not submitted their financial records, Ologbondiyan told THISDAY that the election would not be over until after the election tribunals and the Supreme Court must have delivered judgments on various petitions challenging the outcome of the election.
&ldquo;We are still at the tribunals. The elections are not over. The party will comply with all relevant electoral laws when we finish our petitions at the tribunal &ndash; this time the Supreme Court. So, PDP has not breached any electoral law as regards submitting our financial records to INEC,&rdquo; he stated.
On his part, the spokesman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said he was not in a position to confirm immediately why the ruling party had not submitted the records.
&ldquo;I am not in a position to confirm to you immediately; I can find out soon and I will feed you back later,&rdquo; he said.
Also at the meeting, Yakubu told political parties&rsquo; leaders that the conduct of party primaries and nomination of candidates for the 2019 general election was acrimonious, resulting in court cases on the participation or otherwise of political parties and candidates in elections in many constituencies.
He said this made the management of electoral logistics and post-election litigations more challenging to the commission.&ldquo;At the moment, there are 809 cases challenging the conduct of primaries by political parties in regular courts across the country. This figure is more than the number of petitions challenging the conduct of the main election currently before the election petition tribunals nationwide.
&ldquo;It is, therefore, imperative for political parties to build their capacities for internal democracy, voter mobilisation and financial procedures. Effective running of the political parties is crucial to our democratic consolidation. I want to reassure you that for our part, the commission will continue to work with IPAC as enshrined in the Code of Conduct for political parties,&rdquo; he added.
He also told the political parties&rsquo; leaders to be fully prepared for the forthcoming elections in Kogi and Bayelsa States.
He said: &ldquo;In the next few months, governorship elections will hold in Bayelsa and Kogi States. The elections will hold simultaneously in the two states on Saturday, November 16, 2019. The commission has already released the timetable and schedule of activities for the elections. Party primaries are scheduled to hold from August 18, to September 5, 2019. The deadline of September 5, 2019 is firm and fixed.&rdquo;
According to him, the conduct of primaries and nomination of candidates must be transparent and democratic in accordance with the provisions of Section 87 of the Electoral Act as well as INEC regulations and guidelines.
The commission also expects strict compliance with all rules and regulations by all parties wishing to nominate candidates for the elections as INEC would not accept any nomination arising from primaries conducted after the deadline.He said: &ldquo;So far, three political parties have given us notices indicating the dates for their primaries for both Bayelsa and Kogi governorship elections. The commission once again reminds party leaders to do the needful. In doing so, you should indicate not only the dates but also venues and time for the primaries.
&ldquo;I urge you to avoid persistent rescheduling of your primaries or late minute change of venue which sometimes disenfranchise your members and make effective monitoring by the commission difficult. Where political parties opt for direct primaries, there should be proper register of members otherwise it will amount to conducting an election without the voters&rsquo; register.&rdquo;
He also said the meeting was called to enable both INEC as the electoral umpire and parties&rsquo; leaders as participants to exchange ideas on how to improve the electoral process and conduct elections whose outcomes would not generate much acrimony.&ldquo;I want to assure you that we shall give expeditious consideration to the actionable recommendations from this meeting that fall within the powers of the commission to handle administratively. We shall also work with IPAC to ensure that the required amendments to the legal framework are given speedy consideration by the National Assembly,&rdquo; he said.
On other activities of INEC, the chairman said: &ldquo;As we prepare for the Bayelsa and Kogi governorship elections, we are also preparing for a bye-election in Plateau State. Late last week, we received the declaration of vacancy from the Speaker of the State House of Assembly in respect of Pengana State Constituency following the death of its elected member shortly after he was declared winner in the State Assembly elections held nationwide on 9th March 2019.
&ldquo;This will be the first bye-election so soon after the general election and barely a month after the inauguration of the state assembly. A date will be announced by the commission before the end of this week,&rdquo; he said."
489,"The Chairman, Information and Voter Education of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Festus Okoye Monday in Enugu disclosed that the Commission haswithdrawn 25 certificates-of-return issued to some candidates that won during the 2019 General Elections owing to court orders.Okoye was speaking at a Forum on Media Coverage of the 2019 GeneralElections which was organized by the Nigerian Union of Journalists, NUJ in collaboration with the INEC.
According to him,20 of the 25certificates-of-return were withdrawn from All Progressive Congress (APC)members to other APC members; while two from People Democratic Party (PDP)members were withdrawn to other PDP members.He stated that three certificates were withdrawn from APC and PDP; and givento other political parties.
While commending media practitioners for their enormous contributions during the last election in terms of the provision of reports, Okoye called for continued synergy between the NUJ and INEC to sustainthe progress achieved in the electoral process.He noted that the media had become the first line of reach of the masses as well as a platform through which the INEC relays its political and electoral decisions to the public.``The media should also centre on the aspect of using Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to resolve electoral issues especially at the party levelsinstead of going to the court,&rsquo;&rsquo; he advised.He said, "" the gathering here today is apt and timely. There is always the need to review performance and upgrade standards. We hope that this forum will also generate information in relation to areas that pose challenges to national security and national interest, issues of fake news, hate andinflammatory speeches and issues with the potential of threatening law and order.""I have no doubt that at the end of this discussion, we will be informed and our electoral process will continue to improve, and we will improve onour information management systems.
Earlier in his address, the president of the Nigerian Union of Journalists, NUJ, Com.Chris Isiguzo said that the media and its practitioners were engaged in vast androbust consultations and meetings with INEC before, during and after the elections.
According to him, it showed the extent to which the media was prepared to work closely with the INEC in order to ensure that true democracy prevails during elections.He said that the media and all other stakeholders must always educate electorates on the electoral process to enable INEC continue to deliverfree, fair and credible elections.""
While commending the INEC for conducting free and credible election in the last general election, he said, ""we are here to evaluate the entire process and see where we canstrengthen our engagement and better the electoral system.
He however regretted that the media has continued to face a major challenge of poor working condition which has hitherto affected professionalism of members.
&ldquo;The issue of poor salary structure has remained one of the foundational challenges of the media in this country. When people work at the end of the day, they go home with meager salary. Some people don&rsquo;t even go home with anything&rdquo; he said.
On the way forward, he said &ldquo;we have decided to engage stakeholders in the media industry such as the Nigerian Guild of Editors, The National Broadcasting Commission among others so we can work out something better for our members&rdquo; he said."
490,"South Africa&rsquo;s President, Cyril Ramaphosa has brought the number of women appointed in his new cabinet up to 50 percent, a first for Africa&rsquo;s second-biggest economy.
The 66-year-old leader made this known in a televised address in the capital Johannesburg.
One of those appointed include veteran opposition politician Patricia de Lille as minister of infrastructure development.
Speaking during an interviewon Thursday, South African journalist Verashni Pillay described the move as a surprise adding that it shows that the head of state is wise.
Ramaphosa said he reduced the number of ministers to 28 from 36 by combining a number of posts in a bid to cut spending, promote greater coherence and improve efficiency.

559,"President Donald Trump hasreportedlyordered US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to carry out raids on undocumented immigrant families in at least 10 major cities starting Sunday.

Although ICE Acting Director Mark Morganclaimsthe goal is not to instill fear but to follow &ldquo;the rule of law,&rdquo; ICE officials haveopenly acknowledged they only expect to arrest &ldquo;10 to 20 percent of their targets in each city,&rdquo; and instead make &ldquo;collateral&rdquo; arrests of any other deportable immigrants they encounter.

Like many of Trump&rsquo;s immigration policies, the effect of these raids will be to foster cruelty and terror with the apparent aim todeter others fromseeking refuge or a better life in the US.

Should the planned raids move forward &ndash; the American Civil Liberties Union hasfiled a lawsuitseeking to block them &ndash; there are fears a cascade of human rights abuses will result.

We will see more families locked up in detention centers, sufferingtrauma, suicidal feelings, dangerously inadequate medical care, andsexual assault.

We will see more family separations, causing increased numbers of families to experiencesevere and lasting harm. Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan reportedlycalled off these raidsin early June in part because undocumented parents could be separated from US citizen children. We have already seen that family separations are not temporary &ndash; there are familieswho still have not been identified as separated, let alone reunified since the American public first learned family separations were occurring.

And even more people are likely to go into hiding,pulling children out of school,not reporting crimes, andnot seeking medical care, even for children.

Many of the families targeted for this operation are reported to beasylum seekerswho have received final orders of removal but remain in the US. Arresting and deporting them will only compound any harms incurred while seeking asylum through a process that repeatedly fails to ensure a fair hearing, with court notices sent to incorrect addresses, lack oflegal representation, and the Trump administration&rsquo;snewbarrierstoasylum. Because of these abuses, many with final orders of removal may be entitled to reopen their asylum cases.

The Trump administration seems determined to double down on its abusive policies, making it imperative that Congress passes legislation to end them. In the meantime, state governments, law enforcement agencies, and companies should take steps to avoid being complicit in these abuses.

And they have stood with me through thick and thin, abiding with me in the electoral and legal processes of 2003, 2007, 2011, till God gave us victory in 2015, and also 2019.
&ldquo;Many more people joined us along the line, and the Centre expands by the day. I salute your faithfulness, your persistency, and your ruggedness. It never ceases to amaze me that you have kept faith, even when I have not given you much, or even anything, in return.&rdquo;
The director general of the centre, Dembo, according to the statement assured Buhari that the group will continue to support him to ensure he actualises his mandate for Nigerians.
He was said to have noted that the centre had begun work on institutionalising the philosophy of &ldquo;Buharism&rdquo;.
Dembo said Buhari Support Group Centre will be renamed Buharism Centre in order to share the political vision and philosophy of President Buhari.
The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, have continued to insist the 2019 poll was rigged in favour of Buhari. They also continue to express optimism of recovering the alleged stolen mandate."

493,"President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, met with prominent Nigerians, including his key ally and National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu.
The president&rsquo;s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garuba Shehu, confirmed this development in a statement in Abuja.
Shehu quoted Tinubu after an Iftar dinner meeting with Buhari, as appealing to elderly Nigerians to avoid inflammatory statements that could undermine peaceful co-existence among the country&rsquo;s diverse communities.
According to the presidential aide, the dinner was also attended by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa&rsquo;ad Abubakar III, and Emir of Kazaure, Dr. Najib Hussaini Adamu,
The APC national leader enjoined the citizens to consider the enormity of challenges facing the country and support the president.
He also urged Nigerians to rally round Buhari to solve the problems and stabilise the polity.
&ldquo;The president worked hard and will continue to do so to ensure peace and stability in the country, which are important for the economy to make progress.
&ldquo;These are the key pegs of his agenda. Let us all come together to support him,&rdquo; he said.
According to Tinubu, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is reputed for &ldquo;saucy and distractive statements.&rsquo;&rsquo;
He, therefore, urged Nigerians not to be angry with the opposition party, but assist them to overcome their &ldquo;colossal defeat&rdquo; in the February 2019 elections.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame them. They are handicapped by the traumatic feelings of the colossal loss of the election. You should help them to manage the trauma,&rdquo; he added. The APC national leader commended Buhari for the recognition of June 12 as the nation&rsquo;s Democracy Day.
In his remarks, the Sultan pledged his support to the success of the Buhari administration.
The Sultan led prayers for Buhari&rsquo;s second term in office and for the nation to overcome current challenges.
Other guests at the Iftar dinner were: Nigerian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Justice Isa Dodo (rtd.), Malam Mamman Daura, Isma&rsquo;ila Isa, Mr. Wale Tinubu, and Mr. Hakeem P. Fahm, the Commissioner of Science and Technology, Lagos State."
494,"The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC has said that adequate plans are on ground to deal with the increasing rate of internet fraud in the country.
South East zonal Head of the Commission, Usman Imam disclosed this during a press briefing held by the commission to intimate the general public about the achievements recorded in its fight against corruption, economic and financial crimes in the Zone.
Imam said that in the South East zone for instance, the case of cyber crimes popularly called &ldquo;yahoo yahoo&rdquo; is very alarming and continues to affect the image of not only the zone but the country at large.
According to him, from investigations so far made, it is unfortunate that some parents are not only aware of their children&rsquo;s involvement but even abet such terrible crime.
He regretted that most of the perpetrators of these crimes are students of higher institutions. graduates, youth&rsquo;s corps members and secondary school students who are already learning the ropes from their elders in the nefarious business.
&ldquo;To think that these criminals are those who will in the future, take up the responsibility of leading this country must certainly send shivers down the spine of any right thinking Nigerian&rdquo; he said.
He however said that the commission, as part of its efforts to rid the country of cyber crime, will vigorously enlighten and mobilize the youths in both secondary and tertiary institutions across the zone on the need to stay away from such unlawful acts.
On the successes recorded by the commission in the first quarter of the years, he said that the zone has so far recovered the sum of 102,322,630 and USD $6,450 in the course of its investigation since January 2019 till date.
&ldquo;The successes recorded by the commission in its fight against corruption would not have been possible but for the resolve of the Federal Government to tackle the menace headlong and the renewed impetus brought in by the current leadership of the EFCC headed by Mr. Ibrahim Magu&rdquo; he maintained.
He said that the zone has also received a total of 557 petitions, out of which 127 were approved while 230 were rejected on grounds of being civil in nature and failing under other agencies&rsquo; mandates or are already being in court.
Speaking further, he said that the zone has secured total of 28 convictions, a 100% increase from a total of 14 convictions recorded last year, adding that it is currently investigating cases that are of public interest involving several Ponzi schemes shrouded as corporative or empowerment schemes milking millions of naira from unsuspecting victims.
Imam also recalled that the zone fully participated in the monitoring of the 2019 elections having realized that the commission cannot be said to be fighting corruption without looking critically at the electoral process to make sure they are not only transparent but that people vote their conscience and not out of pecuniary or material inducement.
&ldquo;We wish to assure Nigerians that the commission, despite its achievements is not resting on its laurels but rather poised to rid the country of all forms of economic and financial crimes and corruption&rdquo; he said.

495,"The Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) has listed France, Switzerland, Japan and Australia as some of the countries its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, would be visiting in the coming days.
This came as the group applauded the police in the United States of America (USA) and Canada for providing security to Kanu during his tour in the countries.
IPOB also appreciated Biafran veterans present at Atlanta Georgia, Toronto Canada, Houston Texas, Chicago and New York City, for all their contributions during Kanu&rsquo;s tour to those areas.
Kanu has been touring some foreign countries engaging Igbos and others in town hall meetings and lectures bothering on his group quest for the independence of Biafra from the Nigerian State.
In a statement IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful, released on Tuesday he said:
&ldquo;We congratulate IPOB families and other Biafrans across the US and Canada for the rousing and impressive welcome they accorded our indomitable leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and his team during his recent town hall meetings and lectures held in different cities across the USA and Canada.
&ldquo;We owe a debt of gratitude to the USA and Canadian police that safeguarded the venue of our meetings and provided close quarter protection to our leader at every public appearance.
&ldquo;The level of respect and support accorded to our leader during these events signaled to the world at large and traitors within that our people are fully in sync with the IPOB restoration project and leadership of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu whom God Almighty has anointed to lead the great and noble people of Biafra to our inevitable freedom.
&ldquo;We equally thank all Biafran veterans that made it to Atlanta Georgia, Toronto Canada, Houston Texas, Chicago and New York City, including various socio-clutural organisations affiliate organisations who contributed immensely to ensuring the success of this tour.

496,"Human rights activist, Chidi Odinkalu has said that failure by Nigerian leaders to cater to the needs of the entire citizenry has led to massive loss of lives and disregard for human rights.
Odinkalu spoke at the Big Ideas Podium organized by the African Heritage Institution with the theme: ""HumanRights and Democracy in Nigeria Agenda for a New Era"".
According to him, &ldquo;what we have seen over the years in Nigeria is a cycle of massacre and mass killings in the North East and the upsurge in the rate of banditry in the North West and herdsmen killings in the North Central.
He stated that the Lack of peaceful co-existence and failure of leaders in the country to create common grounds for everyone is part of the reasons why it has remained where it is for years.
&ldquo;Our national leadership has failed us. They have failed to account to us the electorates. And that is why we have had illegitimate government for years now&rdquo; he said.
He maintained that if nothing was done to stop the senseless killings in the North and the rising wave of human rights abuse, it will soon get to the South and then, the entire country will go up in flames.
Speaking further, he said &ldquo;Our politicians believe they can instigate violence anytime for their personal gains because our youths are always willing to be used by them&rdquo;.

&ldquo;As a result, we are a country that is being ruled by ghosts because of the countless number of lives that have been lost. We are only committed to impunity. It is only in Nigeria where people comfortably rig elections and get away with it&rdquo; he said.
On the way forward, he said that leaders in the country must begin to understand that they owe they electorates a duty to protect them and to serve them better.
He said that the country has a rich historical anticendentsand that shows that things could still work out well. &ldquo;We cannot attain democracy or achieve human rights when we do not have a capable country&rdquo; he said.
Also speaking during the event, President,Nigeria Union of Journalists,Chistopher Isiguzo said that the country needs the collective and individual efforts of all Nigerians to deal with the challenge of bad leadership and ensure that human rights is maintained.

497,"Respite came the way of Senate President, Bukola Saraki, Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara and 56 others on Friday, as Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Abuja, struck out the suit seeking their removal from office owing to their defection last year into different political parties other than the one on which they were elected as legislators.
Justice Abang struck out the suit for being incompetent and lacking in merit on the grounds that the plaintiff had no locus standi (legal right) to institute the suit.
The Legal Defence and Assistant Project (LEDAP) had approached the court with a suit seeking to declare the seat of the affected national lawmakers vacant over their defection to the two major political parties in 2018.
Delivering judgment yesterday in the suit filed by LEDAP, Abang held that although the plaintiff had a very good case against the defendants, however its lack of locus standi in the matter robbed the court of necessary jurisdiction to deal on the main issue.
The court agreed with counsel to Saraki and others, Mahmoud Magaji, SAN, that the advocacy body that filed the suit was not competent by law to do so.
&ldquo;I am persuaded to hold that though the plaintiff has a good case, promoting the rule of law, regulating the unlawful defection of legislators amongst others, the plaintiff has no locus standi to institute the suit,&rdquo; Abang held.
According to Abang, the plaintiff lacked the right to institute the suit because it is not a political party, it is not INEC that monitor and regulates political party, neither is it a member of the constituencies of the defectors nor a registered political party.
Moreso, the court held that the plaintiff did not place anything before it to show that the constituencies are aware of the suit or that it has a special interest far above that of the general public.
Abang further held that the plaintiff in filing the suit failed to involve necessary parties, such as the political parties of the defectors. Based on the forgoing, Justice Abang said, &ldquo;I have no jurisdiction to determine the case on its merit because the plaintiff though has a good case but lacks locus standi in the case of the 1st, 2nd, 4th to 58th defenfants, the plaintiff case is incompetent, it is struck out.&rdquo;
He added that to worsen the plaintiff case, it did not obtain the fiat of the Attorney General of the Federation that would conferred power on them to institute the legal action.
Abang held that because the plaintiff lacked locus standi, the court cannot invoke section 68 of the 1999 Constitution against the defectors and declare their seats vacant.
Earlier, while reviewing the submissions of lawyers in the matter, Justice Abang agreed with the plaintiff&rsquo;s lawyer that the defectors violated the Constitution and ought to have vacated their seats, since there was no division of a kind that can warrant their defection.
Meanwhile, in the matter of Senator Godswill Akpabio, the 3rd defendant, the court held that the matter is subjudice because he ought not to have been joined in the first instance. According to him, the Senator representing Akwa Ibom North West in the National Assembly unlike the others did not defect but moved to another party after he was expelled from the PDP.
He held that haven been expelled from the PDP, he has right to join any political party of his choice in order to continue the good work he is doing for his constituencies."
498,"Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has asked Lauretta Onochie, an aide of President Muhammadu Buhari, to tender apology and pay him N500 million for linking him to terrorists.
This was contained in a letter by Mike Ozekhome, lawyer to the presidential candidate.
On May 7, Onochie had tweeted that the former vice-president was on a United Arab Emirates (UAE) watch list.
&ldquo;Atiku on UAE watchlist- Security sources,&rdquo; Buhari&rsquo;s aide tweeted.
&ldquo;Security operatives in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are keeping a close tab on a former Nigerian Vice Pres Atiku Abubakar who has been in the Middle East nation for several weeks now What is he doing there?
&ldquo;Me: Shopping for Terrorists?&rdquo;
In the letter, Ozekhome said: &ldquo;Your odious publication is clearly also aimed at rubbishing our client&rsquo;s image and reputation,&rdquo; the letter read.
&ldquo;It has caused him national and international backlash and embarrassment and done incalculable damage to him.
&ldquo;Your publication has also caused our client, in the eyes of reasonable members of the public, unspeakable odium, obloquy, hatred, ridicule and psychological trauma.
&ldquo;He has thereby been subjected to the shame and infamy of being viewed by members of the public as not only corrupt, but as a terrorist and sponsor of terrorism.
&ldquo;Numerous telephone calls, emails, visits, letters and private social media chats by his family members, friends, political and business associates, and international statesmen and women in the last few days attest to the alarm and serious concerns generated by your false publication.&rdquo;"
499,"The Network of Niger Delta Republic Fighters, a militant group, has threatened to declare a Niger Delta Republic on June 1, 2019.
According to the group, they are not happy with the current situation of the country, especially the alleged maltreatment of people of the region under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The the group made the threat on Monday in a statement by its Director of Information, Maxwell Dan, using last year&rsquo;s police invasion of the residence of Chief Edwin Clark and the suspension, trial and conviction of former Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Walter Onnoghen as examples.
&ldquo;It is quite unfortunate that the story has not changed till today, and we are standing on that declaration; we are standing on the declaration of the sovereign state of Niger Delta and we will declare Niger Delta Republic on June 1, 2019.
&ldquo;It is a common fact that Nigeria has completely derailed from the path of peace, justice and progress as proclaimed by its founding fathers.
&ldquo;As that could not pay off, they remove a Niger Delta son, Mr Mathew Seiyeifa, the most qualified Director of DSS without any due process. Not satisfied with his cruel and selective onslaught against the Niger Delta people, they plotted again and remove our son Justice Walter Onnoghen from office on frivolous allegations without following due process, neither was he given an opportunity of fair hearing.
&ldquo;It is also unfortunate that after four years of this administration, there is no single viable project executed by the Federal Government in Niger Delta despite the billions of naira accrued to the government from the resources of the Niger Delta as a result of the ceasefire in the region&rdquo;, the group said.
The group further lamented the spate of killings going on in the country, concluding that government has not been able to protect its citizens.
&ldquo;The blood of innocent citizens is becoming alarming and it is clear that the government cannot protect the citizens, instead they continue to make unguarded statements without recourse to the safety of the people. It is a common fact the country is under siege and we cannot allow it to consume us&rdquo;, it added."
500,"Wife of former president Goodluck Jonathan, Patience, has asked the Federal High Court in Lagos to order the release of the $5.7m and N2.4bn seized from her by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), arguing that the seizure is not justifiable.
Her lawyer, Ifedayo Adedipe (SAN), on Friday asked Justice Mojisola Olatoregun to also dismiss the application by the EFCC praying that the money be permanently forfeited to the Federal Government.
EFCC had on April 26, 2017 secured an interim forfeiture order of Justice Olatoregun in respect of the funds.
Patience, through her lawyers, had challenged the interim forfeiture order up to the Supreme Court, requesting that the interim forfeiture order be reversed.
The apex court however ordered her to return to the Federal High Court in Lagos to tell the judge reasons, if she has any, why the funds should not be permanently forfeited to the Federal Government.
Speaking before the High Court on Friday, her lawyer argued that it was wrong for the EFCC to tag the money as proceeds of crime, when Patience had committed no crime and when nobody complained that their money was missing.
He maintained that the funds were cash gifts which Patience received when her husband was in office.
Adedipe said such gifts were normal, pointing out that even the wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, Aisha, was seeking to build a university.
The lawyer contended that Section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud, which EFCC relied upon to seize Patience&rsquo;s funds, was only applicable to fraudsters.
&ldquo;It is not the law that if the EFCC finds money in an account and it doesn&rsquo;t like the owner&rsquo;s face, it comes to court and says &lsquo;forfeit it&rsquo;.
&ldquo;The government is at liberty to apply for forfeiture but the offence must be stated.
&ldquo;The first respondent is a wife to a former deputy governor, governor, Vice President, and President.
&ldquo;Even the current occupier of the office of the First Lady wants to build a university.
&ldquo;In this country, First Ladies enjoy a lot of goodwill. She (Patience) stated that governors gave her money. Nobody wrote that she stole their money,&rdquo; the SAN said.
Adedipe said there was no justification for the money to be forfeited to the Federal Government as the EFCC had not proved that Patience stole money from the government or any individual."
501,"The Nigerian Army has accused some Non-Governmental Organisations, NGOs in the Northeast of providing humanitarian support services to Boko Haram terrorists.
The army made the accusation on Thursday the NGOs we&rsquo;re provy support to the insurgents in the form of food and drug supplies.
The army also revealed that its position was based on the confessions of a high profile Boko Haram terrorist commander, Mohammed Modu, who was arrested on Sunday by the troops of 251 Task Force Battalion of the Operation Lafiya Dole.
The also warned the NGOs, in a statement by its acting Director, Army Public Relations, Col Sagir Musa, that it would not hesitate to sanction such organisations, which were not named, if they do not desist.
He said: &ldquo;The army has received disturbing reports indicating that the war against the Boko Haram terrorists is being sabotaged by some stakeholders&rsquo; operating in the North-East. This unfortunate development came to the fore with the arrest of a high profile Boko Haram terrorist commander.
&ldquo;He revealed that the Abubakar Shekau faction of the Boko Haram has been receiving humanitarian support of food and drugs supplies from some Non-Governmental Organisations operating in the North-East theatre.
&ldquo;The army strongly warns the affected agencies to desist from compromising Nigeria&rsquo;s national security and war efforts against terrorism and operate in accordance with the extant rules and regulations guiding the operations of humanitarian aid workers.
The army will not hesitate to sanction any such recalcitrant organisation as appropriate.&rdquo;"
560,"The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) plans a proposal for the alteration of the 1999 Constitution as amended to enable it reduce the plethora of political parties in the country, which it said created for it a logistics nightmare during the 2019 general election.
According to the commission, the large numberof parties, which made it to design very long ballot papers, confused many voters, particularly the less educated, during the election.
If the situation persists, said the commission, not only will the logistics nightmare persist, it would continue to put illiterate voters in a dilemma.
The position of INEC was made known at the weekend by its National Commissioner on Information and Voter Education, Mr. Festus Okoye, in an address in Makurdi, Benue State capital.
He said the commission was planning a review of the process of registering and deregistering political parties as well as how the parties choose candidates for the general election.
According to him, INEC is pushing for amendments to the Constitution and review of guidelines on party registration and deregistration to empower it to tighten up the registration process and delist parties that were &ldquo;mere platforms&rdquo; for political jobbers.
The commission expressed dissatisfaction with the extant registration regime, which it said has led to the nation&rsquo;s electoral process being saddled with an unwieldy number of parties.
Presently, Nigeria has 91 registered political parties of which 73 fielded candidates for the 2019 presidential election.
INEC unfolded its plans just as former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, who was the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last general election denied planning a protest over the commission&rsquo;s denial that it has a server where it stored election data.
In his address, Okoye identified the conduct of opaque and flawed party primaries as the root of the plethora of pre-election matters pending in the various courts.
As part of the overhauling of the party registration process, the commission, he said, would present a new alteration to the constitution that will enable it deregister political parties.
He said: &ldquo;Nigerians must engage in root and branch review of the number of registered parties in Nigeria. The present framework for the registration of political parties is inadequate to guarantee the registration of qualitative, membership driven and ideologically propelled political parties. Some of the political parties are mere platforms and have no concrete and visible presence in most states of the federation.
&ldquo;The presence of too many political parties on our ballot papers has in some instances confused some of our compatriots that are not well endowed in literacy. It has bloated the ballot papers and result sheets and trucking them to the polling units has become a logistics nightmare.
&ldquo;The commission will present alternatives to the Nigerian people, including alteration of the constitutional regime that ties registration of political parties to visible, verifiable and concrete presence and structures in at least half of the states of the federation.
&ldquo;The commission will also propose a rational and democratic threshold for getting on the ballot and save the Nigerian people the phenomena of &lsquo;also ran.&rsquo;
&ldquo;The commission will also propose further alteration of the conditions for the deregistration of political parties as the 4th Alteration to the Constitution is inadequate to weed out dormant and commercial platforms with little or no visible structures and presence in any of the states of the federation. The Nigerian people need political parties that can bid for political power and not mere commercial platforms for hire.&rdquo;
He also decried the acrimonies that usually trail the conduct of parties&rsquo; primaries, which he attributed to the high number of pre-election cases in the court.
&ldquo;The commission believes that the conduct of opaque and flawed party primaries is at the root of the plethora of pre-election matters pending in the various courts,&rdquo; he said, adding: &ldquo;The commission will propose constitutional alteration that aligns the resolution of pre-election issues and the activation of the issuance of certificates of return to the 21-day rule in the Electoral Act, 2010(as amended).
&ldquo;In other words, lodging an appeal within 21 days of obtaining an unfavorable judgment at the court of first instance automatically stays the execution of the judgment and the issuance of a certificate of return pending the determination by the court of Appeal and possibly, the Supreme Court.&rdquo;
He said the commission will engage the leadership of the judiciary relating to the territorial jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to the handling of pre-election matters, contending that a situation where primaries are conducted in one state and all the suits relating to same are trucked to another state for determination is not healthy for the electoral process.
He said the commission would also engage the leadership of the judiciary on multiplicity of court orders on the same issues and by the same parties from courts of coordinate jurisdiction.
Atiku Disclaims Planned Protest over Server
Meanwhile, Atiku, at the weekend, denied reports about his alleged plans to lead a violent nationwide protest if his petition at the presidential election petition does not succeed.
This came as the issue of whether the electoral commission has official server, where the results of the last general election were electronically transmitted to or not continued during the week, with a report querying the N2.27 billion budgeted for server-related procurement items.
Atiku described a statement being circulated against him as handiwork of mischief-makers to mar his pro-democratic record and lay the groundwork for false charges against him.
In a statement by his media aide, Mr. Paul Ibe, the PDP presidential candidate said such a statement did not emanate from him.
&ldquo;I wish to emphatically state that such a statement did not emanate from Atiku Abubakar or his privies. It is the work of mischief makers who want to mar his spotless pro-democratic record and lay the ground work for their threatened actions against him on false charges of being a threat to national security,&rdquo; Ibe said.
He added: &lsquo;&rsquo;For the avoidance of doubt, Atiku Abubakar believes in the rule of law and in the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In his almost four decades in politics, he has never taken action or spoken words against democracy and will not start now.&rsquo;&rsquo;
Atiku added that he has confidence in God and called on those bent on mischief to have the fear of God and retrace their steps."
504,"Ahead of the 2019 general elections and for the first time, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has released a total of 1000 election observers across the country to monitor the elections.
The President of the association, Rev Samson Ayokunle, while speaking on Sunday during a service at the Trinity Baptist Church, Ajobo, Ibadan, Oyo State, said the observers would observe malpractices that may arise during the elections and relay same to the control room at the Christian Secretariat in Abuja.
According to him, &ldquo;You know, for the first time in the history of CAN, we are sending election observers across the federation to observe how elections are going on. &ldquo;If there is any malpractice anywhere, they will report (it) immediately to the control room at the Christian Secretariat in Abuja. We are sending 1,000 election observers across the federation and we had never done that before. It costs money but we are committed to it,&rdquo; he said.
He further noted that except Christians take this week to engage in prayers, it was not certain the elections would hold. &ldquo;About what is happening in the country, I want you to pray very well this week. If it&rsquo;s about the things we see in the spirit, it is not sure that elections will hold at all. We won&rsquo;t want elections to hold like they didn&rsquo;t hold; if that should happen, it would cause trouble or even lead to war&rdquo;. He said.
He also stressed the need for prayers against &ldquo;People who think they are powerful&rdquo; and were determined to sabotage the electoral process to suit their selfish and personal interests at the expense of the over 180 million Nigerians.
CAN, however, expressed confidence in the leadership of the Chairman of Nigeria&rsquo;s electoral umpire, Prof Yakubu Mahmood who it says cannot play with the collective wish of Nigerians.

Kidnappings were rare in Ghana until a spate of abductions late last year, most of them were carried out in demand for ransom.
The media hadreported that the kidnap will be the second time in less than a month that foreigners will be targeted in the city of Kumasi. An Indian national earlier was abducted and rescued.

The DSS operatives arrived in about five buses at the venue at 7am and barricaded the area.

Akinpelu, who insisted they were still looking for other leaders of the coalition, said the botched rally was tagged o to ge (enough is enough) to commemorate the June 12 Democracy Day.

&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to take the law into our own hands and that&rsquo;s why we called the meeting to drum it to the hearing of Mr President, Muhammadu Buhari, that aside declaring June 12 Democracy Day, he should also tackle the issue of insecurity in our land.&rdquo;
According to him, all entreaties by leaders of the group fell on deaf ears of the security operatives who claimed to be acting on &ldquo;orders from above.&rdquo;"

According to a report by the Jerusalem and Brussels-based Worldwide Disaster Group, Israel may eliminate Palestinian neighbourhoods located east of its separation barrier, establishing its de facto annexation of most parts of East Jerusalem.
Reports reveal that areas in Palestine may be removed and placed in separate Israeli administrative units outside of Jerusalem&rsquo;s jurisdiction.
This will be after a new coalition government has been formed following the Knesset election on September 17.
A number of Israeli leaders across the political spectrum have advocated for excising Palestinian-inhabited areas of East Jerusalem.
Israel also intends to advance two of the plans which is cataloguing all occupied East Jerusalem lands in the Israel Lands Registry and inducing Palestinian schools in East Jerusalem to adopt Israeli curricular which Palestinians oppose."
508,"Kaduna state House of Assembly on Friday passed into law a bill that will henceforth regulate religious preaching in the state.
The bill which is named Religious Preaching Regulation law, was passed three years after it faced a serious criticism from different religious bodies and individuals.
The bill, whose goal is to promote religious harmony and peaceful co-existence amongst the residents of the state, was brought to the House in 2016.
At the plenary, Speaker, Alhaji Aminu Abdullahi Shagali, while reading the bill, said a state inter-faith regulatory council has been established with a chairman to be appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the secretary to the state government.
It was also gathered that two members representing the Christian and Muslim faiths will be appointed by the Governor, among others.
According to theSpeaker, the bill further states that the above mentioned council shall hear and determine appeals brought before it arising from the decision of the local government inter-faith committee and also has power to issue regulations considered necessary to guide the state inter-faith council and local government inter-faith committee in the performance of their functions.
He further mentioned that the bill stipulates that in each of the 23 local government areas of the state, a committee to be known as the Local Government Inter-faith Committee has to be established.
According to him, the local government inter-faith committee shall consider and recommend to the state Inter-faith Regulatory Council all applications for the grant of licence to religious preachers as well as screen and recommend preachers for the grant of license among other functions.
The supplementary provision explained that all cassettes, compact disks (CDs), flash drives or any other communication gadgets containing religious recordings from accredited preachers may be played inside a private dwelling unit or vehicle, entrance porch (zaure), Church, Mosque and any other designated place of worship.
It further stated that any person who plays religious cassette or uses a loud speaker for religious purposes between the hours of 11pm to 4am in a public place, and uses a loudspeaker for religious purposes other than inside Church or Mosque commits an offence and shall on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years or pay a fine of less than N200,000.00 or both.
The bill added that any person who publicly insults or incites any religion by making false statements in such a manner as to be likely to lead to a breach of peace, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years or a fine of not less than N100,000.00 or both."
509,"Following the recent attacks experienced by Southwest people in the hand of Fulani herdsmen, governors from the region have announced their readiness to curtail the menace.
The governors made this known after a meeting held at the Ondo State Governor&rsquo;s Lodge in Abuja on Friday.
Ondo state governor, Rotimi Akeredolu in a statement after the meeting said &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an urgent need to stem the growth of criminal activities and banditry in our region and, as leaders, we must be proactive in our approach to addressing the issue.&rdquo;
The meeting which was attended by Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu; Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi; Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde; and Osun State Governor, Mr Gboyega Oyetola, unanimously adopted Akeredolu as the chairman of the South-West Governors&rsquo; Forum.
Recall that various Yoruba groups, elders and leaders in recent time had lampooned the lackadaisical attitude of the Federal Government towards the invasion, and unprovoked attacks by herdsmen across the country especially in the South-West.
The Yoruba Council of Elders, YCE, Afenifere, Agbekoya Farmers&rsquo; Association, Soludero Hunters Association, the South- West Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and the All Progressives Congress, APC, were among those who expressed misgivings about the nefarious activities of herdsmen particularly in the South-West.
The groups also expressed worry over the herdsmen&rsquo;s incursion in the region, submitting that the region is under siege."
510,"A warning has been directed to Northern youths for issuing an ultimatum to the Federal Government, to implement the now suspended Ruga settlement policy which has generated much controversy.
The warning was issued by Niger Delta militants which kicked against the 30-day ultimatum by the youths to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Government to implement the Ruga settlement policy.
According to John Dukku, leader of the agitating militants in a statement issued on Sunday, it was unfortunate that the Northern groups would call for the implementation of a policy, that had been suspended and also issued a quit notice to Southerners resident in the region.
&ldquo;The attention of the Coalition of Niger Delta Agitators has been drawn to the recent second round of 30 days ultimatum issued by the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) to the Federal Government to forcefully implement the suspended RUGA settlement for Fulani herdsmen across the country or they will resort to self help and destruction of lives and property of Southerners resident in the North.
&ldquo;The Coalition of Northern Groups further issued an ultimatum to Southerners living in the North to vacate if their various state governments refused to donate lands to federal government for the implementation of its suspended Ruga settlement within the said 30 days.
&ldquo;We are surprised that in a time like this when killings of innocent citizens is the order of the day by CNG brothers, we thought CNG and Arewa youths would have risen above ethnic sentiments to condemn the unprovoked killings and the high rate of poverty in the land, rather they are bent on worsening the already tensed situation by issuing unwarranted threat.
&ldquo;While we see the recent RUGA settlement plan by the Federal Government as its plot to Fulanise and Islamise the entire country by proxy. We also want the CNG to note that there is no settlement in the entire Northern part of Nigeria allocated to any tribe or ethnic group of Southern origin by the federal government under any name or guise.
&ldquo;Therefore the recent threat by CNG is ill-conceived and foolishly advised by their sponsors/war mongers who feel they are super humans.
&ldquo;We therefore also want to re-echo that the entire South-South and Niger Delta would never part with any of its land to Fulani terrorists no matter the amount of threat.
&ldquo;We advise the Northern youths and the Presidency to build their planned Fulani settlements in Sambisa forest and stop chasing shadows as forceful implementation of such ethnic plan would only spell doom for the country.
&ldquo;The Coalition of Northern Groups, Arewa Youths, MACBAN, Northern Elders, the Security Agencies and the Presidency should note that any Niger Deltan or Southerner killed by Northern youths as a result of this threat shall receive severe and adequate response from us&rsquo;&rsquo;, the militants stated."
511,"MOHAMMED Morsi, former Egyptian president who was ousted by the army in 2013, has died in court.
The 67 year-old-Morsi was said to have died after collapsing during a court session where he was facing episionage charges on Monday in Egypt.
Morsi was inaugurated in June 2012 as Egypt&rsquo;s first democratically elected president, but he was overthrown in July 2013, a year after he took office.
Morsi wasunseatedby a military coup led by his defence minister, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Fattah had been ruling Egypt since then while Morsi had remained in custody.
After his removal from power, Egyptian authorities launched a crackdown on his supporters and the Muslim Brotherhood.
The hearing in the capital, Cairo, was related to charges of espionage emanating from suspected contacts with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, according to state television.
In 2015, Morsi wassentencedto death after being convicted of colluding with foreign militants &ndash; from the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas and Lebanon&rsquo;s Shia Islamist Hezbollah movement &ndash; to organise a mass prison break.
However, after some international organisation campaigned against the move, the death sentence wasquashedin 2016 by Egypt&rsquo;s highest court of appeal.
Executive Director, Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, Sarah Leah Whitson tweeted that the news of Moris death is &ldquo;terrible but entirely predictable. She said the government failed to &ldquo;allow him adequate medical care and fewer family visits. &rdquo;
The Human Rights Watch was just finalizing a report on his health, shetweeted."
512,"President Muhammadu Buhari has said that he will face the threat of terrorism with full force, noting that it is time for a new way forward that completely removes the threat of terrorism.
Buharimade this statement while speaking at a bilateral meeting with President Idris Deby Itno of Chad Republic in Makkah, Saudi Arabia where both leaders are attending the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) summit.
He announced that he will be hosting leaders of the Lake Basin Commission to an informal Security Summit on the sidelines of his forthcoming Second Term inaugural ceremonies slated for June 12 in Abuja.
The summit is to come up with new strategies to bring to a permanent end, the Boko Haram terrorism being faced by the countries of the Lake Chad region.
In a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity,Garba Shehu, it was revealed that the two Presidents agreed that &ldquo;the time has now come for the regional leaders to sit down to agree on how to change the unwinding nature of the war.
&ldquo;This is to achieve a sustained operation, to continue until the threat is brought to a permanent closure&rdquo;.
Buhari noted that now that elections were over and he is now back in full force, it was time for &ldquo;a new way forward that removes completely&rsquo;&rsquo; the threat of terrorism from the Lake Chad sub-region.
The statement said: &ldquo;The two leaders shared information on the oncoming rainy season and challenges that it poses for the ongoing military operations. They agreed on the need for urgent operational measures before that time.
&ldquo;They also talked about how the meeting in Abuja should respond to the infiltration through Libya of the displaced elements of the Daesh, which is an acronym of ISIL&rsquo;s Arabic name al-Dawlah al-Islamīyah fī l-ʻIrāq wa-sh-Shām into the Lake Chad area,&rsquo;&rsquo; the presidential aide added."
513,"National Chairman, Arewa Pastors Non-denominational Initiative for Peace, Bishop Abu Richard has defended President Muhammadu Buhari, stating that he is not the cause of the killings in the country.
While briefing newsmen at a Pre-swearing-in Prayer Meeting on Saturday in Abuja, Bishop Richard said former President Olusegun Obasanjo&rsquo;s accusation of Islamization is highly condemnable.
He nonetheless expressed sadness over the kidnappings and killings in the country, advising Buhari and security operatives to be proactive rather than reactive to avoid crisis.
The cleric also called on Nigerians both Christians and Muslims to continue to pray for a better government in the next four years of Buhari&rsquo;s administration.
He said: &ldquo;The accusation of Islamization by former President Olusegun Obasanjo is highly condemnable. As a child of God and by my exposure, the President cannot Islamize Nigeria with the Vice President, who is a Christian.
&ldquo;President Buhari is not the cause of these killings. Most of these killings have been going on before he took over power. That is why we have fasted today and prayed that God should strengthen him.
&ldquo;We also call on the security agencies to put in more efforts to stop these killings and we pray for a good 9th National Assembly that will be able to work with the government of the day with good policies to develop this country.
&ldquo;We pray for Buhari to do much better as he will be sworn in for the second tenure. From his statement and all that we have been hearing, we believe that through God he will perform better.
He prayed that God should give the nations selfless leaders like the President, men and women of wisdom and understanding; leaders who would not cause God&rsquo;s people to err."
514,"Amid violent clashes and a deteriorating security situation in Tripoli, the UN has called for the evacuation of vulnerablerefugeesand asylum-seekers from the detention centres.
This cameafter clashes last month between Gen Khalifa Haftar&rsquo;s rebels and pro-government groups.
The media hadreported that a Libyan militia raided a detention centre, Qasr bin Ghashir, near Tripoli last month
The attack left at least two people dead and 20 injured after the refugees were being shot at indiscriminately by militias.
While detainees are being left without enough food and water with toilets and showers broken, the UN has also revealed that food and water are in short supply while conditions such as tuberculosis are rife.
Libya has been torn by violence and political instability since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011."
515,"THE European Union (EU) says from 30 recommendations made after the 2015 general election monitoring, only four were considered by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government while 26 others were ditched.
Among those dropped was the amendment of the Electoral Act, believed to be capable of promoting transparency in the nation&rsquo;s electoral process, thereportnotes.
Other discarded recommendations were transparent result processes, protection of media freedom, improved measures for more women participation in politics among others.
Notable Nigerians had on several occasions clamoured for the passage of the 2018 Electoral Act (Amendment) bill which was eventually passed by the National Assembly.
Buhari receivedknocksfor eventuallyrejectingthe bill despite the expectation of mostNigerians.
&ldquo;In 2015, the EU EOM made 30 recommendations. Of these, four were implemented, including two priority recommendations. These included the introduction of continuous voting rather than the cumbersome procedure of voters being accredited in the morning and voting in the afternoon. In addition, time limits were established for pre-election day petitions. The other two relate to continued biometric identification checks during polling, and scrutiny by civil society,&rdquo; the report says.
&ldquo;Other recommendations from 2015 were not implemented. These included a more transparent results process, stronger measures for parties to promote women, and provisions for protections of media freedoms and plurality. The Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, if assented to, would have increased the number of recommendations implemented as it included many positive measures including provisions on results transparency.&rdquo;
The report, which detailed another set of 30 recommendations, revealed that Nigeria has the lowest rate of women in parliament in Africa, with the number progressively decreasing since 2011.
It stated further that, during the 2019 elections, number of women in the National Assembly fell below five per cent.
Among other issues, the EU 2019 election monitoring team, headed by Maria Arena, however, identifiedprosecutionand sack of the former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Walter Onnoghen, less than a month to the election, as one of the perceived notable actions of destroying the judicial independence and defeating the essence of separation of power.
According to the report, suspension of Onnoghen did not also follow due process, divisive and has weakened the hope of developing the electoral process.
&ldquo;Three weeks before the original election date, the president suspended the chief justice of Nigeria. This had an inhibiting effect on the judiciary. It was seen by many as undermining security of tenure, damaging judicial independence and compromising the division of powers.
&ldquo;The suspension did not follow due process, was divisive, and undermined confidence in the electoral process and opportunity for remedy. He was later subject to compulsory retirement by the National Judicial Council. The chief justice has a key role in deciding the Supreme Court bench for hearing final pre-election appeals as well as governorship and presidential petitions.&rdquo;
The Mission further blamed INEC for consistently failing to prosecute electoral offences, thus caused all forms of impunity.
The election observers, who covered all the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT),gave verdict that the poll was marred withirregularities."

Ugwuanyi spoke in Enugu during the swearing-in ceremony of 2019 Batch &lsquo;B&rsquo; Stream One corps members posted to the state which held at the NYSC Permanent orientation camp, Awgu.
According to him, the Federal Government deserves to be commended at all times for they efforts put in place to energize the scheme which avails corps members ample opportunities to learn and improve themselves.
Ugwuany, who was represented at the occasion by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Nwanneka Onah, said that the NYSC has grown to be an effective vehicle for national integration and focusing on mobilizing the youths for economic development over the years.
While calling on all Nigerians to support the scheme so it can be sustained, he urged all those posted to the state to take their trainings seriously as the current economic paradigm in the country favours those who have developed self-sustaining skills.
&ldquo;It is imperative that every well meaning Nigerian should support the continued existence and sustenance of the scheme and also work out ways of repositioning it for more efficiency&rdquo; he said.
He also noted that corps members deployed to the state have always contributed to its socioeconomic growth and development, adding that his administration is committed to ensuring the effectiveness and success of the orientation course.
""This administration would continue to articulate and implement policies and programmes aimed at making the youths central to the execution of development programmes&rdquo; he said.
Earlier in his address, the NYSC State Co-ordinator, Stephen Dewan said that a total of 2,202 corps members were participating in the orientation course.
He said that the corps members would, while carrying out their primary duties, assist in ensuring that the policies of the State Government were successfully implemented.
He noted that the course activities were designed to prepare the corps members mentally, emotionally and physically to brave up for the challenges of the service year.
&ldquo;Your predecessors did well and proved that they youths of this great country are worthy to take over the mantle of leadership in the future. You must not fail on your path&rdquo; he said.
He commended the State Government for its efforts aimed at improving on the existing infrastructure in the orientation camp.

517,"More reactions trail the Federal Government announcement of its plan to create a Fulani radio for herdsmen. This is as the Peoples Coalition Party (PCP) advised that the plan be shelved.
According to the PCP, the move would be seen as promoting herdsmen killings, terrorism, banditry and the vandalisation of properties and homes of law abiding citizens.
In a statement signed by its National Chairman, Anthony Harmattan, on Saturday in Abuja, the party urged the government to concentrate on creating employment for all youths in the country.
The statement reads: &ldquo;We vehemently call on the Federal Government to quickly shelve it&rsquo;s planned creation of herdsmen radio station in the country.
&ldquo;Most importantly, our government must avoid being seen as a promoter of herdsmen Killings, defender of terrorism, banditry and the vandalisation of properties and homes of law abiding citizens of Nigeria.
&ldquo;We call on the Federal Government to concentrate their efforts and developmental focus towards creating jobs for all active youths in the country in order to reduce the menace of kidnappings, killings and armed robbery now ravaging every parts of the country.
&ldquo;Our passionate call also goes to all aggrieved parties in the last general election to resolve to put the country first by peacefully engaging themselves in the tribunals and not attempting to overheat the polity.
&ldquo;Finally, we appeal to the government and the ruling party, the APC to embrace a reconciliatory posture by ensuring that all stakeholders are considered in an inclusive government to foster development, peace, progress, fairness, equity and justice to all. Nigeria needs absolute unity at this time in our history.&rdquo;
Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, had on Wednesday said the Federal Government had acquired an Amplitude Modulation broadcast radio licence, frequency 720KHz, for herdsmen as part of efforts to end the perennial farmers-herders clashes.
&ldquo;The radio service will serve as a vehicle for social mobilisation and education, in addition to interactive radio instruction methodology that will be adopted to reach the very hard-to-reach segment of our target population,&rdquo; he had noted.
The announcement has however been greeted with a wide range of condemnations.
Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum cautioned the Federal Government not to proceed with its plan to set up a radio station for Fulani herdsmen, warning that the station would become a weapon for spreading hateful propaganda against other nationalities.
Also, three senior lawyers, Femi Falana, Ladi Rotimi-Williams and Monday Onyekachi Ubani, all ruled the decision illegal, stating that there was no evidence of due process in sourcing and securing public fund for the project.
Similarly, an NGO, Advocacy for Advancement of Peace and Harmony in Africa Initiative (ADAPHAI) had slammed President Muhammadu Buhari claiming the move is draging Nigeria to political Armageddon.
It said the development has exposed President Buhari as nothing but an ethnic bigot and unrepentant chauvinist with less requisite qualities of national leader.
Amidst the wave of condemnation, the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, a Fulani socio-cultural association, however described the initiative as a &ldquo;positive&rdquo; step in the right direction."
518,"President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with families of victims of bomb blasts at a viewing centre in Mandarari, Konduga Local Government Area of Borno State.
Buhari&rsquo;s condolence message is coming a day after he sent a similar message to families of over 50 killed by bandits in Zamfara and Sokoto states recently.
The attack in Mandarari, which happened on Sunday, is said to have left no less than 30 citizens killed following multiple bomb blasts supposedly carried out by terroristBoko Harammembers.
The attack was said to have also left 40 others wounded.
In his condolence message, which was made public by his special adviser on media, Buhari decried the heinous acts, stressing that perpetrators of evil acts have &ldquo;judgment awaiting them, not only from man, via the long arms of the law, but also from God Almighty.&rdquo;
He urged security agents to sustain surveillance in all theatres of security challenges in the country, taking into consideration the unconventional methods deployed by terrorists to harm innocent and unsuspecting victims.
The President then commended the efforts of emergency response workers and humanitarian organisations.
According to Adesina, Buhari prayed that &ldquo;God will grant the souls of the departed eternal rest and comfort their families.&rdquo;
Hardly any week passes without reports of Nigerians being killed in their tens if not hundreds, either by terrorist Boko Haram, bandits, killer herdsmen, kidnappers, cult groups or other criminal elements.

519,"Nigeria Watch, an annual report supported by the French Institute for Research in Africa (IFRA) and the French National Research Institute for Development (IRD), has said violence claimed no fewer than 10,665 lives across the federation in 2018 alone.
The watch, which primarily monitors lethal violence, conflict and security in Nigeria on annual basis, has also claimed that there was a 1.4 per cent increase in the number of violent deaths in the country in 2018, saying fatalities rose from 10,515 in 2017 to 10,665 in 2018.
The report traced the roots causes of violent deaths to land dispute, religious conflicts, cattle grazing and terrorist insurgency, among others.
In its break-down analysis, the 17-page report claimed that Boko Haram insurgency killed 2,135 in 2018 compared with 2,829 fatalities recorded in 2017, thereby representing a decline of 28 per cent.
Likewise, the report said cult-related killings accounted for 453 deaths in 162 incidents while 238 people were killed in 76 kidnap incidents.
Also, the report revealed that in 2018, 2,331 victims were killed in 350 lethal incidents involving security operatives.
Ogun State, according to the report, maintained its position in 2018 as the state with the highest prevalence of fatal road accidents.
The most dangerous states in Nigeria in 2018, the report said included Borno, Zamfara, Benue, Kaduna and Adamawa, as the states were mostly ravaged by the Boko Haram insurgency, banditry and pastoral conflicts.
It added that Ekiti, Gombe, Jigawa, Osun and Kebbi states were relatively peaceful, though recorded a minimal number of violent deaths.
The report said 2018 marked a rise in general crime across the country, noting that banditry was prevalent in Zamfara and Kaduna States.
It added that the first quarter of the year &ldquo;witnessed massive killings in Benue and Plateau States by alleged herdsmen, as Rivers and Lagos States also recorded large incidents of cult attacks in 2018.
&ldquo;Delta, Ebonyi, Cross River and Akwa Ibom states witnessed rise in inter-state and intra-communal clashes that resulted in several loss of lives and properties&rdquo;."

North Korea said Friday that nuclear negotiations with the United States will never resume unless the Trump administration moves away from what Pyongyang described as unilateral demands for disarmament.




The statement by an unnamed North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman published in state media was the country's latest expression of displeasure over the stalled negotiations as it continues to press Washington to soften its stance on enforcing sanctions against the isolated nation&rsquo;s crippled economy.




It came as President Trump prepared to travel to Japan for a summit this weekend with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in which the North Korean nuclear issue will probably be high on the agenda.




In the statement carried by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency, the spokesman accused the U.S. of deliberately causing February's collapse of talks between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with unilateral and impossible demands.




""We hereby make it clear once again that the United States would not be able to move us even an inch with the device it is now weighing in its mind, and the further its mistrust and hostile acts toward the DPRK grow, the fiercer our reaction will be,"" the statement said, referring to North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.




""Unless the United States puts aside the current method of calculation and comes forward with a new method of calculation, the DPRK-U.S. dialogue will never be resumed, and by extension, the prospect for resolving the nuclear issue will be gloomy,"" the statement added.




The U.S. has said the Trump-Kim talks broke down because of North Korean demands for sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. Kim has since declared that the Trump administration has until the end of the year to come up with mutually acceptable terms for a deal.




Friday's statement follows two separate launches of short-range missiles this month, which ended a pause in North Korea's ballistic missile launches that began in late 2017 and was seen as measured brinkmanship aimed at increasing pressure on Washington without actually causing the negotiations to collapse. North Korea has also strongly protested the recent U.S. seizure of a North Korean cargo ship that had been involved in banned coal exports and demanded the vessel to be immediately returned.




The unsuccessful Trump-Kim summit, North Korea also significantly slowed the pace of its engagement with South Korea, which has been eager to improve bilateral relations and help revive discussions between Washington and Pyongyang.




South Korea this week vowed to push ahead with plans to resume large-scale humanitarian aid to the North. But it's unclear whether any aid package from South Korea would influence the behavior of North Korea, which has been demanding much bigger concessions from Seoul, such as the resumption of inter-Korean economic projects currently blocked by U.S.-led sanctions against Pyongyang.

He made this comment while speaking at the 2019 Post-Election Review session with the second batch of Electoral Officers from 17 states, held in Abuja on Wednesday.
According to him, the level of improvements recorded in the nation&rsquo;s electoral system from 1999 to date prompted his assertion.
Yakubu said that the commission should be rated high when compared with its counterparts in other West Africa countries.
He said: &ldquo;Whenever I compare what we have done with what my colleagues elsewhere have done, I sometimes say we are many countries in West Africa rolled into one.
&ldquo;Given the size of our voter registration, our population, one can conveniently say, if you look at what happened in our elections from 1999 to date, I have no doubt in my mind that INEC is the most improved public service institution in Nigeria.
&ldquo;We have offices in all the Local Government Areas. Tell me one agency which has offices in LGAs and the staff work as hard as our EOs and staff at the LGA levels?
&ldquo;We have everything to be very proud of, but however, we never rest on the understanding that we have done very well and we are doing very well. We are convinced that we can do more.
&ldquo;Therefore, the purpose of this interactive meeting is for us to explore ways and means by which we can improve the system,&rdquo; he said."
523,"THE Southern Cameroon Legal Assistance Network (SC-LANE) has asked the governments of Nigeria and Cameroon to respect the rights of Southern Cameroonians who are seeking asylum in Nigeria.
There are currently more than 30,000 refugees registered by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Nigerian Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCRMIDP).
Counsel to the Southern Cameroonian refugees in Nigeria, Abdul Oroh, who is also the Coordinator of SC-LANE toldthe mediaon the occasion of World Refugee Day that the two countries must work to ensure the safety of the refugees, noting that no one deserves to be called &lsquo;illegal refugee.&rsquo;
He emphasized that governments of both countries must respect the UN Charter on Safety of Refugees particularly, Convention Relating to Status of Refugees.
Oroh lamented that despite an Abuja Federal High Court ruling in March 2019 ordering the release of 10 detained leaders of Southern Cameroon by the Paul Biya led Francophone Cameroon government, they are still being kept in Kondengui Prison Principale, Yaounde, Cameroon.
&ldquo;It is sad that despite the ruling given by Justice Chikere Anwuli of Abuja Federal High Court that these men be released, they are still kept in the prison,&rdquo; Oroh said.
He stressed that the Justice in the verdict described the detained Southern Cameroonian leaders as &lsquo;retornists&rsquo; as against secessionists that the government called them.
On January 5, 2018, 12 leaders of the Southern Cameroon Ambazonia Interim Government led by Sisiku Ayuktabe Julius were meeting at NERA Hotel, Jabi, Abuja to discuss the refugees&rsquo; situation and a surge in violence when they were arrested by Nigerian security operatives.
The UNHCR office in Abuja was outraged by the abduction and drew the attention of the Nigerian government to their international obligations under article 33 of the Geneva Convention that protects the rights of refugees and prohibits refoulment, which is expulsion or return of refugees to hostile territory.
While two of the arrested Southern Cameroonian leaders who claimed Nigerian citizenship were transferred to the police custody, the remaining 10 were deported to Cameroon on January 25, 2018, where they have since been tried by a Military Tribunal.
The SC-LANE coordinator further lamented that the whereabouts of 37 Cameroonian refugees picked up at random on December 31, 2017, in Gembu, Taraba State by Nigerian soldiers is still unknown.
There have continued to be an influx of Southern Cameroonians into Nigeria since the Paul Biya-led government clamped down on members of Southern Cameroon Nigeria Council (SCNC) and the Southern Cameroon Ambazonia United Front (SCACUF) who declared independence on October 1, 2017.

The Commission said that the issue of multiple taxation on the telecoms industry has also discourage investments which continue to deny government of long-term revenues.
Speaking on Thursday during its South East Stakeholders Parliament WithRelevant Agencies in charge of Telecommunications matters, the Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management Of NCC, Sunday Dare said Telecoms platforms are providing a leapfrogging opportunity for emerging economies like Nigeria to catch up with the so-called developed world by taking the place of Oil which used to be the World&rsquo;s most valuable commodity.
Dare who was represented by the head, Compliance Monitoring, NCC, Alkassim Umar however regretted that it was a matter of great worry that at this point in history, we are still talking about protecting telecoms infrastructure from interference by agencies of government when all levels of government should encourage operators to build infrastructure in their domain.
He explained that though the current practice of imposing heavy sector-specific taxes and charges on telecoms infrastructure and decreeing onerous regulations may appear to bring immediate revenues to the coffers of the State, it discourages investments in the Telecoms industry, deny government of long-term revenues and as we as destroy the foundations for future growth.
He maintained that there was the need for us to work towards win-win solutions that enable operators roll-out fast and efficient networks which create opportunities for our citizens and develop our economies.
""The World Bank and other developmental organizations have continued to provide empirical evidence that if the industry is able to increase the penetration of broadband and ICT infrastructure by just 10%, then it can boost national GDP by as much as 2.5% in just one year""he said.
He noted that dependence on telecoms infrastructure will in fact grow as we move to the 5G era where our homes, our offices and our entire lives would be interconnected by telecoms networks.
""But we must take a long-term view of the need to provide a conducive environment for the spread of telecoms infrastructure, be they Base Transceiver Station Sites (BTS), or fiber infrastructure"" he noted.

525,"Following unending attacks by Boko Haram terrorists, no less than four Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Borno State are currently &lsquo;completely inaccessible&rsquo; for humanitarian assistance, the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has said.
This is coming at a time the Nigerian military declared as fake news, the report that a faction of Boko Haram, Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP), attacked and captured Marte LGA in the state.
But UNICEF in its report entitled &ldquo;Situation overview and humanitarian needs&rsquo;, listed Marte, Abadam, Guzamala, and Kukawa as the four areas completely inaccessible owing to terrorist attacks.
The report said, &ldquo;The security situation remains volatile, with a significant impact on humanitarian access. Four LGAs remain completely inaccessible &ndash; Abadam, Guzamala, Kukawa, and Marte &ndash; to humanitarian actors while access to Kala Balge LGA (Rann) remains severely constrained.
&ldquo;UNICEF has only been able to conduct a limited number of day trips to Rann &ndash; Kala Balge LGA, where the nutritional situation of children appears to be deteriorating.
&ldquo;A rapid MUAC -Middle Upper Arm Circumference- screening of children under five by community mobilisers revealed that 263 out of 460 children screened were suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). UNICEF is planning to provide treatment for both severe and acute malnutrition using extended criteria. Acute needs have also been identified by other sectors, including wash, shelter/NFI and food security.
&ldquo;Many other LGAs are only partially accessible, and the number of armed clashes and attacks remains consistently high across the state. A marked deterioration in road security has further increased humanitarian actors&rsquo; reliance on UNHAS helicopters to reach many locations, including Monguno, where there are significant humanitarian needs following the arrival of nearly 15,000 newly displaced.&rdquo;
On when the situation is likely to improve the report said: &ldquo;Humanitarian actors consider it unlikely that the security situation in the majority of LGAs of Borno State will allow for any population return in the near future, either of IDPs or refugees. The urgency of overcrowding and congestion of camps is rising as the rainy season approaches, particularly in Maiduguri and Monguno where more than 20,000 people are still sleeping under open skies&rdquo;."
526,"The World Food Programme will start to suspend its operations in parts of the country Houthi rebels control as soon as this week if the group does not agree to implement a biometrics system intended to prevent aid fraud, the head of the UN agency said on Monday.
WFP Executive Director David Beasleytold the UN Security Councilhe had signed agreements with the Houthis on biometric registration of aid recipients starting last December, but &ldquo;every time we got close to actually putting those agreements into place, there would be a new roadblock.&rdquo;
If the WFP does not receive &ldquo;assurances&rdquo; that these agreements would be honoured, &ldquo;we will begin a phased suspension of food assistance, most likely towards the end of this week,&rdquo; Beasley warned.
Discussions on putting a biometrics system in place have been ongoing for months, after a series of allegations &ndash; both in themediaand by WFPitself&ndash; that Houthi-aligned local officials have diverted aid by manipulating the lists of beneficiaries, re-selling stores of food aid, and falsifying records.
The UN&rsquo;s food aid agencydelivers monthly rations, cash, or vouchers to 10.2 million people in Yemen&ndash; its largest operation in the world. On Monday, UN relief chief Mark Lowcock told the Security Council there were &ldquo;famine-like conditions in dozens of places across Yemen&rdquo;.
Data Dispute
The WFP says biometric registration of a new database of aid recipients, already in place in some parts ofYementhat the Houthis do not control, would ensure aid gets where it is supposed to. But the Houthis haveobjectedto the programme on the grounds that they, rather than the WFP, should be in control of the data.
The WFP firstsuggestedin May that it was considering a &ldquo;phased suspension&rdquo; of its activities in Yemen because of the delay in implementation, but this is the first time the agency has publicly given the Houthis a timeline.
Two UN officials and a Houthi source &ndash; all three requested anonymity because they weren&rsquo;t authorised to speak to the media &ndash; said that while meetings on the issue are ongoing, WFP has given the Houthis a deadline of later this week to agree to the biometrics programme before it begins to suspend aid deliveries.
A source inside the Houthi-run National Authority for the Management and Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or NAMCHA, confirmed that WFP had said it would stop operations in Sana&rsquo;a only if the Houthis did not agree to the biometric registration by the agency&rsquo;s deadline.
&ldquo;We refuse the enrolling of beneficiaries in a biometrics programme because it is counter to national security,&rdquo; the NAMCHA source said, adding that the Houthis were still in talks with the WFP to find an alternative to thebiometrics programme.
At the Security Council, Beasley said stopping operations &ldquo;goes against every fibre of our being&rdquo;, but that it might be necessary to protect the &ldquo;integrity&rdquo; of the United Nations. &ldquo;I am begging the Houthis... to let us do what we do best:save lives,&rdquo; he said.
For more than four years, Houthi rebels, officially called Ansar Allah, have been fighting the internationally recognised (but mostly exiled) government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and its allies in a Saudi Arabia and UAE-led coalition.
The war has left more than 20 million people &ldquo;food insecure&rdquo; by the UN&rsquo;s estimate, and led to widespread malnutrition, an unknown number of deaths from hunger, andconsistent warningsthat the country is on the brink of famine.
A partial, phased suspension
If the WFP does decide on a suspension, the announcement will be made from the WFP&rsquo;s headquarters in Rome, according to a leaked email sent on 13 June by WFP Yemen country director Stephen Anderson.A WFP source confirmed the authenticity of the email.
In the email to staff, Anderson said a &ldquo;partial, phased suspension [in food assistance] remains the option of last resort, one we hope to avoid,&rdquo; and that while talks were ongoing to head off the stoppage, &ldquo;we also need to be prepared to take action in order to preserve the accountability of the Yemen operation.&rdquo;
&ldquo;In the event of a suspension, nutrition programmes for women and children will continue,&rdquo; the email stated.
One of the two UN officials said aid would first be paused in the Houthi-run capital city of Sana&rsquo;a, but it wasn&rsquo;t yet clear how many people could be impacted.
The UN official said that if the stoppage does happen, beneficiaries in Sana&rsquo;a might be notified by text message that they would not be receiving their rations. The official added that the WFP hopes to continue negotiations with the Houthis even if food deliveries are slowed in Sana&rsquo;a and possibly other Houthi-controlled parts of the country."
527,"Presidential candidate of Young Progressive Party (YPP) in the 2019 elections, Kingsley Moghalu has blamed northern elites and politicians of encouraging poverty among the masses.
Moghalu made this statement on Sunday while speaking at the Ra&rsquo;ayi Initiative for Human Development (RIHD) annual lecture, in Kano.
He spoke on &ldquo;Northern Nigeria&rsquo;s prosperity in the 21st Century: The imperative of social and economic transformation.&rdquo;
According to him, the selfishness of the northern political class remains the major cause of poverty and under-development in the region.
He wondered why the North could hold power at the centre for 42 years and still remain &ldquo;the headquarters of poverty in Nigeria.&rdquo;
He said solutions for repositioning the North are based on re-setting of the people&rsquo;s mindset and worldview, insisting that, &ldquo;the problem with the North is the North versus itself.
Moghalu urged northerners to make human development their priorities, adding that there was a nagging need to fight youth unemployment, drug abuse and upgrade the status of women in the region.
He advised that the almajiri system of education should be supported with Western education, pointing out there need to increase the enrollment of women in schools, &ldquo;because if you educate a woman, you have educated a village.
&ldquo;The north must be modern. Nigeria and the northern Nigeria will not make progress until Nigeria is constitutionally re-structured.&rdquo;
He noted that Nigeria cannot develop on &ldquo;feeding bottle federalism,&rdquo; noting what Nigeria needs at this point in time remains true federalism that will encourage fiscal independence of the regions.
He called on northern elite to put heads together in revitalizing Kano&rsquo;s industrial prowess, as well as making huge investment in mechanized and value-chain agriculture.
Moghalu further charged traditional rulers and religious leaders in the north to play major roles in re-setting the worldview of northerners to tally with development agenda of the 21st century."
528,"Wife of the president, Aisha Buhari, has said that she wants to be addressed as the first lady of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, henceforth.
This is contrary to her husband&rsquo;s campaign promise not to recognise the office of the first lady which he had said was unconstitutional.
&ldquo;The office of the first lady is not in the constitution, so there&rsquo;s no official role for them,&rdquo; Buhari had said in the buildup to the 2015 presidential election.
After her husband announced his reservations for the office, Aisha agreed that she would perform her role traditionally if Buhari scrapped the office.
&ldquo;If the office of the first lady is constitutionally recognised, he will not tamper with it; but if it is not, that&rsquo;s okay. For me, I will perform my duties and role as the wife of the president of Nigeria traditionally,&rdquo; she had said during the inaugural meeting of the APC women presidential campaign in 2014.
But that was five years ago. Speaking at a ceremony for wives of governors in Abuja on Thursday, Buhari&rsquo;s wife demanded to be addressed as first lady, saying this should take immediate effect.
She said the title: &ldquo;wife of the president&rdquo;, had been causing confusion among governors&rsquo; wives and that had to be resolved.
&ldquo;When my husband was elected newly, I personally chose to be called the wife of the president,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But I realised that it was causing confusion from the state as to whether the wives of state governors are to be addressed as the first ladies or wives of the governors.
&ldquo;So, forgive me for confusing you from the beginning, but now I choose to be called the first lady.&rdquo;




"
529,"The Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, yesterday, June 19, 2019 dismissed the appeal filed by Prince Lawrence Ezeh of the All Progressives Congress (APC) challenging the judgement of Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja which upheld the election of Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani as the senator representing Enugu East Senatorial District.
Ezeh had instituted a suit to disqualify Nnamani as the validly nominated candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), alleging irregularities in the signing of his nomination form.
The appellate court agreed with the earlier decision of Justice Ekwo which dismissed the original suit for lacking in merit and being statute-barred.
Counsel to Ezeh, Dr. Frank Ikpe had argued extensively that the case was not statute-barred and that the lower court erred in law not to have proceeded to the merits of the claim.
However, counsel Nnamani, Obinna Onyia, holding brief for Dr. Onyechi Ikpeazu, SAN, in opposing the appeal argued that the originating summons was not brought in compliance with Section285(9) of the constitution (as amended).
Also, counsel to the PDP, Tobechukwu Nweke urged the appellate court to dismiss the appeal as being frivolous and lacking in merit.
In dismissing the appeal, the three-man panel of the appellate court, in the judgement read by Justice Mohammed Idris, JCA, adopted the arguments canvassed by the respondents agreeing with the judgement of Justice Ekwo that the plaintiff did not initiate the suit within the 14 days allowed by the fourth alteration to the constitution.
The appellate court concluded that the appeal lacked merit and dismissed same.
It will be recalled that the Court of Appeal, Enugu Division, had on Monday, June 14, 2019 dismissed an appeal by the former senator representing Enugu East Senatorial District, Prince Gilbert Nnaji, seeking to unseat Senator Nnamani based on a similar premise.
The appellate court had in a unanimous decision resolved the issues for determination in favour of Nnamani and his party, the PDP, agreeing with the April 5, 2019 judgment of Justice Ibrahim Buba of the Federal High Court sitting in Enugu that the original suit was filed outside the 14-day period allowed by law from the date of the occurrence of the event.
The appellate court had therefore dismissed the appeal as being statute-barred and lacking in merit.

530,"Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday revealed what he feels is the reason Nigeria is faced with growing insecurity and different other challenges.
According to Osinbajo, these multiple challenges are happening because the country is at the threshold of the breakthrough its citizens have been praying and hoping for many years now.
He stated this when he celebratedEid-el-fitr with President Muhammadu Buhariat the new Banquet Hall, State House, Abuja.
The Vice President, who described Nigeria as a country of one people, said those making statement capable of disuniting the country will never achieve their aims.
&ldquo;Mr. President, the country as we speak today, is at the threshold of greatness and you have said so yourself so many times. In any situation that something great and important is about to happen, there would usually be many negative and opposing forces that would want to keep that from happening.
&ldquo;And I believe that our country is at the threshold of the breakthrough that we have been praying and hoping for all these many years. This is why many challenges are showing up; challenges around security, challenges around division, people who are stoking up embers of religious and ethnic divisions.
&ldquo;But this gathering is one of those gatherings that those of us in leadership; political leadership and religious leadership, demonstrate to our people that this country is a county of one people; the Nigerian people.
&ldquo;We may be different in our faiths, different in our ethnicities, but we are one people, the Nigerian people are one and united.
&ldquo;For that reason, I would want to commend all of our leaders who are here, for making this a tradition that we would come together as Christians and Muslims, and people of different faiths, for this particular event; not only to demonstrate our respect and pay our homage to Mr. President on this occasion, but to demonstrate to our people that this country is a united country and that those who want to stoke up embers of division would not be allowed to do so.
&ldquo;So, I really want to urge all of our leaders who are here, religious and political leaders that we must not allow the rhetoric of division to supersede the rhetoric of unity. We must also speak up; we must speak in ways that unite our country.
&ldquo;We cannot keep quiet because there are so many negative statements being made every day and sometimes we ignore those statements and say &lsquo;these are people who have no understandings.&rsquo;
&ldquo;But if we allow these negative statements to continue, then they will define our country and define the situation of our country.
&ldquo;As I said, our country is destined for greatness and I know that the Almighty God will lead us to that greatness. And as we go day by day towards that greatness, those who want to hold us back, the Lord God Almighty will prevent them from doing so,&rdquo; Osinbajo said."
531,"Operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCSC) in Borno, on Wednesday, confirmed the arrest of one Aliyu Muhammed, a 24 year-old suspected Boko Haram Improvised Explosive Device (IED) logistics supplier in Maiduguri.
The Commandant of the corps, Ibrahim Abdullahi, disclosed this in an interview with the media in Maiduguri.
Abdullahi said that the suspect was nabbed by men of the command on April 25, following intelligence report while he was on his way to supply bomb materials for Boko Haram terrorists.
He said that preliminary investigation conducted by the command, revealed that the suspect supplied mobile phones battery, wrist watches as well as laptop computers used for setting off IEDs designed to inflict massive casualties.
&rdquo;The suspect who pretends to be a tricycle operator in the town, has executed many missions for the insurgents.
&ldquo;He also operates several bank accounts, where he recieves funds for boko haram in the last six months.
&ldquo;He usually receives large sums of money from the Republic of Chad, through a third party account number to avoid being detected.
&ldquo;We have so far tracked dozens of his transactions especially at commercial money transfer centers within Maiduguri,&rdquo; he said.
The NSCDC commandant said Mohammed and his colleagues have played different roles in masterminding various attacks, in worship centers, market places in Maiduguri and environs.
Abdullahi reitrated the commitment of the command toward complimenting efforts of the army, police and other sister agencies in the counter terrorism campaign in the Northeast.
&ldquo;The command had within the past two years arrest morethan 25 Boko Haram insurgents, comprising of female suicide bombers, commanders and collaborators in Maiduguri.
&ldquo;The command had, through the dispute resolution department encauraged morethan 40 terrorist to lay down thier arms and accepted meaninful rehabilitation and reintegration through the Operation Safe Corridor window opportunity provided by the government,&rdquo; he said.
He added that the suspect would be handed over to the 7 Division Garison of the army for further interogagion and profilling."
532,"The world should impose a moratorium on the sale and use of surveillance software until there are rules in place to stop governments using it to spy on opponents and critics, a U.N. expert recommended.
David Kaye, the U.N. special rapporteur on freedom of expression, submitted his recommendations in a report published on Tuesday to the U.N. Human Rights Council, which will open a three-week session next week.
Kaye said he had received detailed testimony about governments using spyware developed and supported by private companies, but the market was shrouded in secrecy.
&ldquo;Surveillance of specific individuals &ndash; often journalists, activists, opposition figures, critics and others exercising their right to freedom of expression &ndash; has been shown to lead to arbitrary detention, sometimes to torture and possibly to extrajudicial killings,&rdquo; he wrote.
&ldquo;States should impose an immediate moratorium on the export, sale, transfer, use or servicing of privately developed surveillance tools until a human rights-compliant safeguards regime is in place.&rdquo;



Kaye cited the examples of Pegasus spyware, produced by Israel&rsquo;s NSO Group, which he said had been identified as being used to target individuals in 45 countries, and FinSpy, also known as FinFisher, produced by German-British Gamma Group.
Gamma Group did not immediately comment.
NSO Group said its technology was a vital tool to save lives and stop terrorists and criminals who used encrypted technology, and all companies providing such services had an obligation to ensure ethical use of their technology.
&ldquo;It is not a tool to be weaponized against human rights activists or political dissidents,&rdquo; NSO said in an emailed response. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why there is such a high bar for ever becoming a licensed customer.&rdquo;
In his report, Kaye said government oversight of spyware &ldquo;hardly exists&rdquo;, and there was an &ldquo;extraordinary risk of abuse&rdquo;.
Governments were conducting surveillance without fear of any legal consequence, and companies were failing to meet the most basic principles of protecting the human rights of people affected by their products and services.
&ldquo;Digital surveillance is no longer the preserve of countries that enjoy the resources to conduct mass and targeted surveillance based on in-house tools. Private industry has stepped in, unsupervized and with something close to impunity.&rdquo;"
533,"President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday reassured Nigerians that his administration would soon bring violent killing of Nigerians by bandits and other criminal elements to an end.
Buhari, who has constantly assured Nigerians of their security, reiterated his position on the issue when he commiserated with the government and people of Zamfara State on the recent infiltration of bandits who killed several innocent citizens in Tsafe Local Government Area of the state.
In a statement through his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari condemned the incident, describing the bandit attacks as callous and despicable.
He then assured the people of Zamfara and other Nigerians who have lost loved ones to violent attacks that &ldquo;the government under his watch will soon bring such dastardly acts to an end.&rdquo;
The statement also said he commended the new administration in Zamfara State for putting in new security measures to curtail the activities of criminals and bandits and urged the citizens not to despair but to see the latest attack as a challenge to step up collective actions to rout the enemy, in partnership with the Federal Government.
While urging law enforcement agencies to take prompt and timely actions against the attackers, President Buhari appealed to citizens to have faith in the security agencies by giving them useful information on plans and the movements of the bandits."
534,"Former President Goodluck Jonathan has advised the newly elected members of the National Assembly to modify the laws in order to prevent a &ldquo;repeat of what happened in 2019&rdquo;.
According to him, protests and rejection of vote results that arose after the polls were caused by lack of confidence in the electoral system.
Jonathan made this statement on Monday during a public lecture and presentation of a book titled &ldquo;Excellence in Governance and Creativity: Legal Essays&rdquo; which was in honour of Rivers state governor, Nyesom Wike.
He said African nations should establish minimum standards that their electoral management bodies should adopt to deepen the credibility of the process.
He also, suggested that for there to be positive improvements, Africa must look into to full electronic voting.
&ldquo;Parliamentarians who have won elections to go the national assembly should take a look at what happened in the 2019 elections. We must modify our laws to make sure that in the 2023 elections, some of these things don&rsquo;t repeat,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;If democracy must endure in Africa, then the process leading to elections and the conduct of elections must be done in a way that people will have confidence in the system.
&ldquo;I believe that in Africa, for us to move forward we have no choice but to look forward to full electronic voting.
&ldquo;This is debatable because a number of people are afraid that somebody hiding in his toilet can change the figures by pressing one or two buttons on a device, but we can&rsquo;t run away from this.
&ldquo;It is the ultimate and we must get there. But before we get there, we have to make sure that Nigeria and other countries must come out with a minimum and acceptable standards of constituting our electoral management bodies, in a way that will inspire the confidence of the people.
&ldquo;As a nation we must move forward. Nigeria is a very important country in Africa and we must set the pace in some of these areas. We must not wait for other countries to come and teach us how we should elect our people.&rdquo;
Jonathan recounted his experience when he led an election observer team to monitor South Africa&rsquo;s national and provincial elections.
He said, &ldquo;In South Africa, the first impression the electoral observer missions had was that political parties had confidence in the electoral management body known as the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC),&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;All the political parties we discussed with also had confidence in the IEC and that happened because they were not constituted by just one person.
&ldquo;They also had maximum confidence in the security system. With that kind of confidence in place, at least more than sixty percent of the problem is solved.&rdquo;"
535,"2020 could mark the end of the colonial CFA Franc currency in 8 countries when ECOWAS introduces a new West African regional currency. It will be a win for African integration and a big loss for neo-colonialism.
After two days of high-level discussions, West African ministers and central bank governors recentlyagreed on a draft reporton the establishment of a regional currency.
The report will be reviewed by heads of State in July, 2019 on the establishment of a new regional currency. Among the key issues agreed upon are the exchange-rate regime and the monetary policy framework.
The Ivorian Finance Minister, Adama Kone told the press, ""At a ministerial level, we've established a roadmap."" This means West Africa is on track to have a single currency which will replace the problematic CFA Franc in eight countries in West Africa, provided they meet theconvergence criteria.
Thefranc de la Communaute Financiere de l&rdquo;Afrique (CFA Franc) is a currency embroiled in controversy primarily due to its colonial roots. In January 2019, Italy's populist Deputy Prime Minister, Luigi Di Maioaccused France of underdeveloping and colonizing Africa. 

He argued, ""France is one of those countries that by printing money for 14 African states prevents their economic development and contributes to the fact that the refugees leave and then die in the sea or arrive on our coasts."" Maio added that ""If Europe wants to be brave, it must have the courage to confront the issue of decolonization in Africa.""

The CFA Franc is pegged against the Euro and proponents argue that this has brought stability to West Africa by insulating it from inflationary pressure.

However, opponents have argued that the currency is a colonial relic and maintaining it is anachronistic. After all, the CFA Franc was created on the 26th of December in 1945 by General de Gaulle's declaration. France intended to facilitate financial integration among its colonies and it is unclear why the colonial currency lived beyond the end of colonialism. 

After independence, the Francophone countries of West Africa signed monetary cooperation deals which pegged the CFA Franc against the French franc and later, the Euro.

However, the states also had to deposit 50% of their external reserves to the French treasury. The French haveretained economic controlover their previous colonies but that era is coming to an end.

In the words of Guinea's Alpha Cond&eacute;, ""I am a supporter of a regional currency and in 2020 we will have a single currency in the ECOWAS countries, whether they speak English, Portuguese or French, and CFA franc will become outdated."" 

Hopefully, the bloc does not postpone the process yet again as has happened since the adoption of the ECOWAS Monetary Cooperation Programme (EMCP) of 1987 in Conakry."
536,"Nineteen governors from the northern part of the country yesterday met with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja and appealed to him to take more decisive and swifter action on the violence ravaging the region.
The region has come under massive pillage by Boko Haram insurgents in the North-east, armed bandits and kidnappers in the North-west, and killer herdsmen in the North-central.
Faced with prospects of economic and social degradation due to the virtually unchecked violence of these non-state actors, the governors demanded and got audience with the president, asking him to save the region from the devastation of the criminals.
At the end of the meeting yesterday, Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State told State House Correspondents that Buhari listened attentively to them and pledged to take more concrete actions to end the reign of the hoodlums who had made life uncomfortable for the citizens of the region.
He said the president assured them that serious steps would be taken to restore public confidence in the ability and capacity of the government to execute its constitutional responsibility of securing lives and property of the citizens.
Masari said the governors briefed the president on the escalating security concerns in the region and called on him to stop the banditry, kidnappings and cattle rustling that had combined to foist a security siege on the northern part of the county.
According to him, the decision to meet the president over security crisis confronting the north was taken at a meeting of northern governors 10 days ago in Kaduna.
He said whereas insecurity used to be prevalent in the North-east because of the activities of Boko Haram, the trend has changed in recent times with escalating cases of banditry and cattle rustling in the North-west and North-central.
He added that the governors resolved to meet the president to express their concerns and to find a way of restoring public order.
He said they told the president on the need to act on the matter quickly and decisively to forestall the situation getting out of hand.
The president, on the other hand, assured them that something drastic would be done to bring the menace under control.
Masari said: &ldquo;The issue that brought us to the president is about the rising insecurity in the North-west, North-central and North-east. North-east is known for Boko Haram insurgency but of recent, what was known to be cattle rustling in North-west and some parts of North-central has turned out to be something different from what we had before.
&ldquo;So, this concern made us to come and brief the president so that urgent action would be taken in order to curb this deadly menace of banditry, which is gradually graduating into insurgency. You know the North-west with a vast forest area going to North-central and then even going out of Nigeria.
&ldquo;So, we need to act quickly and decisively so that it doesn&rsquo;t turn into something else like what we had in the North-east.&rdquo;
Asked on the development on the kidnap of Magajin Gari Daura 26 days ago in front of his house, in Daura, Katsina State, Masari said: &ldquo;I think the police are working seriously and they have made some progress but for obvious reasons, they cannot disclose all what they have done for security reasons but work is going on.&rdquo;
Present at the meeting aside Masari were Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), Senator Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), Malam Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari (Zamfara), Mr. Simon Lalong (Plateau), Alhaji Sani Bello (Niger), Alhaji Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Alhaji Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa) and Alhaji Kashim Shettima (Borno).
President Promises Not to Let Nigerians Down
Later yesterday, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in a statement, quoted the president as saying that he will not let the nation down on security.
He quoted the president: &ldquo;The security of the country is on my mind 24 hours of the day. I get daily and weekly situation reports.
&ldquo;I have listened to your brief. I will look into your recommendations. I am acutely aware of the situation, but I have learnt more today.
He said the president bemoaned the ravaging effect of unchecked corruption in the past on the country&rsquo;s armed forces, saying &ldquo;the terrible effects of mismanagement were prevalent, and these are the consequences.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If you follow the efforts we are making within the system, you will see that we have curbed much of the corruption that is there. See the recoveries that we have made &ndash; money, landed property. We are not going as fast as we want under the system, but we will keep trying to improve it,&rdquo; the president added.
Buhari said he would increase the frequency of his meetings with security chiefs and keep updating himself.
Buhari also told the governors that normalcy had returned to the North-east, adding that the governors warned that banditry was posing a dangerous threat and needed to be tackled with equal swiftness."
537,"THE Police in Abuja on Monday invited for questioning Chidi Odinkalu, lawyer and human rights activist, in connection with a petition issued by the Kaduna State government over allegations of inciting public disturbance, among other charges.
The invitation was in connection with statements purportedly made by Odinkalu during an interview with a television station early in the year in which he questioned claims made by Kaduna State governor Nasir el Rufai that 66 persons were killed in the Kajuru crisis in the state.
Apparently, the Kaduna State government, through its Attorney General, Umma Hakima, had on April 4 petitioned the Inspector General of Police, IGP, transmitting the order of a Kaduna Magistrate Court to causing an investigation into some charges brought against Odinkalu by the Kaduna State government.
It was learnt that the government had applied, through an exparte application, that the Magistrate Court presided over by Hon Ibrahim Musa, order that the charges brought against the respondent be investigated by the police.
Specifically, the underlying allegation contained in the ex-parte application dated March 28, 2019, is that in a television interview on 16 February, Odinkalu stated:
&ldquo;I keep coming back to this Kajuru story because we must never allow that story to get away. 66 Nigerians killed; that&rsquo;s 66 too many. If anybody claims that 66 people were killed in Kajuru this week, including the Governor of Kaduna State, let us go and verify. I&rsquo;m not willing to allow that story to go away. It is not true.&rdquo;
According to the application by the state government, reinforced in its petition to the IGP, by making this statement Odinkalu committed the following offences:
&ldquo;Furnishing false information punishable under s. 104 of the Penal Code, Laws of Kaduna State 2017;
injurious falsehood, punishable under s. 373 of the Penal Code, Laws of Kaduna State 2017;
public nuisance, punishable under s. 150 of the Penal Code, Laws of Kaduna State 2017; and
inciting disturbance, punishable under s. 77 of the Penal Code, Laws of Kaduna State 2017.
Odinkalu, who noted that he arrived at the Federal Criminal Investigation Department, FCID, Abuja around 3.30pm, said he was asked to write a statement based on the allegation and that he denied all of them.
&ldquo;I was asked to make a statement on the stationery of the Police under caution. I did. My statement essentially affirmed my name, occupation and identity. I also affirmed the words stated above as mine but denied clearly that I had any intention to or was indeed capable of or had committed any of the offences alleged.
&ldquo;In particular, I did say that in the circumstances of the facts, the conduct of the Governor of Kaduna State appeared to have been designed to preclude the Nigeria Police Force from doing its lawful duties of investigating or verifying his allegations.&rdquo;
He said he was hearing of the case against him at the Magistrate Court for the first time during the police questioning although the Magistrate, from the document he was shown, made the order since March 22.
Odinkalu has since been let go by the Police although he had to be granted bail on self-recognition and can be invited on the matter again."
538,"The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal has dismissed the petition of the Coalition for Change (C4C) challenging President Muhammadu Buhari&rsquo;s victory in the February 23 presidential election.
This is as a result of an application for withdrawal of the petition filed on Monday by the petitioners on June 10.
C4C and its presidential candidate, Geff Chizee Ojinika, had filed the petition marked: CA/PEPTL/003/2019, in which they complained of unlawful exclusion or misrepresentation and sought the cancellation of the election and the conduct of a fresh presidential election.
Also, they complained that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) printed CC and against its actual acronym of C4C, a development, they claimed worked to their disadvantage.
During the court session on Monday, the counsels representingPresident Buhariand the All Progressive Congress (APC), Wole Olanipekun and Lateef Fagbemi, informed the court that their clients was yet to be served with a copy of the petition.
Olanipekun said at the last adjourned date, the panel had granted an application for substituted service but that up till Monday morning, the petitioners were yet to serve the processes on the first respondent.
Responding, the counsel representing C4C, Obed Agwu, informed the tribunal that an application for the withdrawal of their petition against the election of Mr Buhari was filed on Monday in court but was yet to be served on the respondents.
Following the non-objection of the application by other parties involved in the matter, the five-member panel led by Justice Mohammed Garba accordingly granted the application and dismissed the suit.
The petition by the C4C is one of the four cases brought against the victory of President Buhari and that of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), in the presidential poll.
Others are those filed by the Hope Democratic Party (HDP) and Ambrose Owuru, who claimed to be the party&rsquo;s presidential candidate (marked: CA/PEPC/001/2019); the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate,Atiku Abubakar(CA/PEPC/001/2019); and the People&rsquo;s Democratic Movement (PDM) and Pastor Aminchi Habu, listed as the party&rsquo;s presidential candidate (CA/PEPC/004/2019)."
539,"President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday expressed confidence in the Nigerian security and law enforcement agencies, saying they have the capacity to protect the country from different security problems afflicting it.
The president reiterated this while attending to some delegates of Zamfara Advocacy Group who were at the State House in Abuja to make their concerns known to him.
The President said the military and the police have been taking drastic measures to check the activities of some local elements threatening the peace of the communities, including preventing farmers from going to their farms.
In a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media &amp; Publicity), the president said: &ldquo;I assure you, I get daily reports from people in the field and traditional rulers. I also meet regularly with the leadership of the security agencies, and they have been directed to deploy their personnel to secure the society.&rdquo;
Describing as &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; the &ldquo;failure of local leadership in intelligence- gathering,&rdquo; the President enjoined community and traditional leaders to monitor closely the activities of people in their domain with a view to assisting law enforcement agencies to secure the communities.
Commending the new governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, for being proactive in addressing the security challenges, the President urged royal fathers to go back to their cultural roles.
The leader of the group, Usman Balarabe, while congratulating President Buhari on his re-election, said the &ldquo;situation in Zamfara remains dire,&rdquo; citing increased attacks, deaths, injuries and displacements.
&ldquo;We are here because we believe Mr. President and his administration can put in place solid measures to bring about peace and security and also mitigate the endemic poverty that has made this region one of the poorest in the world&rdquo;, he said.
Among the delegation were the wife of Kaduna State governor, Asia Mohammed Ahmed, and renowned journalist, Kadaria Ahmed.
They called for greater collaboration among stakeholders; securing the borders; and permanently situating a major military presence in the State, among other suggestions."
540,"The National Judicial Council (NJC) has confirmed President Muhammadu Buhari&rsquo;s acceptance of former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen&rsquo;s voluntary retirement.
NJC&rsquo;s Director of Information, Soji Oye, made this known in a statement on Monday.
According to the statement, the council held an Emergency Meeting on Monday to take formal note of the acceptance of Onnoghen&rsquo;s voluntary retirement.
&ldquo;The President&rsquo;s acceptance of the retirement is in line with Council&rsquo;s recommendation to the President on 3rd April, 2019.
&ldquo;Council at the end of its deliberations, thanked the President for the acceptance which was in the best interest of Nigeria,&rsquo;&rsquo; Oye said.

NJCcommended the President for accepting Onnoghen&rsquo;s exit from the Bench."
541,"The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has informed the European Union that Nigerians are living in despotic times under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
The PDP in a statement issued by its Deputy National Chairman, Elder Yemi Akinwonmi, stated that much in Abuja on Friday, when he received the European Union (EU) Election Mission.
According to him, the APC-led federal government has greatly eroded the country&rsquo;s democracy.
Elder Akinwonmi also called for the intervention of the international community to save the country&rsquo;s democracy, noting that if the alleged anti- democratic tendencies of the government are not checked, the next generation of Nigerians may not witness a democratic government.
&ldquo;We are now living in a despotic environment. We are now living in time of strange changes. Nigeria is fast becoming a failed state. The international community should beam its searchlight on Nigeria. What is going on Nigeria must not go unchecked if you want democracy to survive,&rdquo; Akinwonmi stated.
He also added that apart from endangering democracy in the country, has equally impoverished the people, noting that the government has weakened the economy so much that the naira is the weakest in the continent."
542,"Nigerians, especially those who witnessed the civil war between 1967-1970, have been asked to learn from history and save the country from sudden destruction.
The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation,Ohanaeze Ndigbogave the warning on Friday,
The organization noted that there are ominous sings of bleak future for the country.
The president general of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Nnia Nwodo, stated this in a statement by his media aide, Emeka Attamah, warning that the clouds are gathering and Nigerians must beware of another civil war.
He was responding to the Tuesday election of the 9th National Assembly leadership, that saw the South-East ending up without any leadership positions.
&ldquo;There is no future for Nigeria. As long as the north decides to be unreasonable and realistic, this country can never get better.
&ldquo;The country is only heading for implosion as long as equity and fairness is denied some sections of the country.
&ldquo;The only solution is restructuring or the country will eventually hit the rocks. If not today, tomorrow. What does it cost to be fair and live in peace ?
&ldquo;Certainly, nobody will blame anybody if emotion runs high and the thread holding the country becomes thin and snaps .
&ldquo;No condition is permanent in life. There are ominous signs and the clouds are gathering.
&ldquo;Let the remaining generation that witnessed the Nigerian civil war recant and save the country from the cataclysm that will envelop her if the upcoming generation are allowed to inherit the callousness and wickedness pervading the land now. Nigerians beware of civil war,&rdquo; the statement read."
543,"President Muhammadu Buhari Saturday said his administration was winning the war against banditry, kidnapping and insurgency bedeviling the country.
He assured Nigerians that ending the carnage in the Northwest region and other parts of the country remained the cardinal objective of his administration.
Buhari explained that Federal Government was poised to creating an enabling environment for lawful citizens to go about their legitimate duties without impediments.
President Buhari, who stated this in Katsina at the 4th convocation ceremony of the Federal University, Dutsin-Ma (FUDMA), said his administration would end insecurity soon.
Buhari, represented by the former Deputy Governor of Kano State, Professor Hafiz Abubakar, said: &ldquo;I want to assure the people of Katsina State and indeed all other States of the federation that the climate of fear being orchestrated by the bandits, kidnappers and insurgents would soon come to an end&rdquo;.
While admitting that the war against bandits and kidnappers involves numerable covert operations that are not assessable by the citizens, the president urged Nigerians to work together for the sustainability of peace in the country.
According to him, &ldquo;We have no other country we can call ours, but Nigeria. We must stay here and salvage it together&rdquo;.
He, however, challenged management of Nigerian universities to come out with shells to conduct research that would prompt industrialist to patronise their institutions to enhance their capacities to produce and diversify their products.
&ldquo;It is not heart-warming that in over 58 years of independence, Nigerian Universities are slow in discoveries and inventions&rdquo;, President Buhari said.
The President said although, the country was facing funding challenges at all levels, &ldquo;Universities have both the legal and internal revenue muscles to generate fund to finance research and other academic activities&rdquo;.
He therefore, urged Nigerian Universities to adopt proactive measures that would boost their Internally Generated Revenues (IGR) to complement federal government&rsquo;s efforts of improved IGR.
In his welcome speech, the acting Vice Chancellor of FUDMA, Professor Adamu Baba-Kutugi, said inadequate security arrangement, lack of staff accommodation, inadequate students hostels and poor road network were predicaments facing the varsity, hence the need for government to assist the institution.
Earlier, the Chancellor of the institution, Dandeson Douglas Jaja, lamented that the university had not been able to utilised the student accommodation provided at the main campus due to security challenges.
He said: &ldquo;This university faces daunting problem in respect of security of lives and properties. The main campus of the university has been located in a volatile area security-wise&rdquo;."

The UN special rapporteur and Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of slain journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who were both at an event in London on Tuesday night, also called on the international community to act upon a report published by Callamard on June 19.
&ldquo;I would like you to use this report as a means to prevent an attempt to silence us,&rdquo; Cengiz said at the conference, which took place at Amnesty International&rsquo;s headquarters. She urged European countries to &ldquo;take this report more seriously&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Unfortunately since the report, there have been no serious steps against the criminals who have done this, or support from the member states of the [UN] Security Council,&rdquo; Callamard added.
Her six-month investigation concluded the disappearance of the Saudi journalist was a state killing, carried out by agents of Saudi Arabia using state resources.
Khashoggi who had been a columnist for The Washington Post had on October 2 last year, Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to pick up documents that would allow him to marry Cengiz, who waited for him outside the diplomatic office.
The pen-pusher was however reportedly killed by Saudi agents inside the building and his remains have stiil not yet been found."
545,"Another report of alleged gory experience Nigerians witnessed under President Muhammadu Buhari&rsquo;s first term in office has emerged.
The new report claimed that no less than 25, 794 Nigerians lost their lives in violent crises from June 2015, few days after Buhari assumed power, to May 2019, when his first four years in office expired.
The report is a research work of Nigeria Security Tracker, which is a project of the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonprofit think tank specialising in United States foreign policy and international affairs.
The report is coming just as the Economist, recently painted a horrible picture of the Nigerian situation under Buhari&rsquo;s administration, claiming that Nigerians became the world&rsquo;s poorest citizensunder Buhari&rsquo;s government.
The latest report on violent killings, noted that the figure on those who make-up the number wereNigerians killed Boko Haramterrorists in the North, herdsmen, as well as people who died in extrajudicial activities of the military.
The report puts the number of citizens killed in Borno, which has suffered more from attacks by factions of terrorist Boko Haram at 9,303 deaths.
Next to Borno is Zamfara (1,963) and Adamawa (1,529). They were followed by Kaduna (1,488), Plateau (771), Taraba (649), Benue (1,642), Niger (252) Rivers (730), Cross River (467), Ogun (301), among others.
The report showed that graphically, July 2015 had the highest number of Nigerians killed violently with 1,299 casualties, followed by January 2019, when 1,077 were killed.
During the four year under review, Boko Haram is said to have been responsible for the deaths of 5,598 Nigerians, while sectarian violence, including the herdsmen-farmers crisis resulted in the deaths of 4,917 Nigerians.
The report further revealed that state actors, including the military, killed 4,068 people.
On deaths during the preceding administration of PresidentGoodluck Jonathanfrom June 2011 to May 2015, it was reported that a total of 34,884 people were killed across the country.
Of the 34,884 casualties during that period, Boko Haram and the military were together responsible for 12,765 deaths.
On the methodology used to arrive at the data, the Council on Foreign Relations explained it relied on media reports.
&ldquo;The Nigeria Security Tracker tracks violence that is both causal and symptomatic of Nigeria&rsquo;s political instability and citizen alienation. The data are based on weekly surveys of Nigerian and international media.
&ldquo;The data start with May 29, 2011, the date of Goodluck Jonathan&rsquo;s inauguration as president. It was an event that highlighted the increasing bifurcation of the country on regional and religious lines. The NST is updated weekly.
&ldquo;Relying on press reports of violence presents methodological limitations. There is a dearth of accurate reporting across certain regions, death tolls are imprecise, and accounts of incidents vary. There is the potential for political manipulation of media. Given these limitations, the NST makes every effort to collect information from multiple sources. Nevertheless, NST statistics should be viewed as indicative rather than definitive,&rdquo; the Council said."
546,"The Managing Director/ CEO of the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency, (NEMSA), Peter Ewesor has said that the National Meter Station in Enugu State will become operation by the first quarter of 2020.
Ewesor said that when fully operational, the station will among other things; cater to all metering services in the region as well as testing and certification of energy meters, all of which will ensure that technical standards are maintained.
Speaking in Enugu during the inspection of the station, Ewesor said that its establishment in Enugu rather than Portharcourt or Lagos is part of efforts by the Ministry of power to ensure that regions around the country feel the impact of the transformation that is currently ongoing in the ministry.
&ldquo;We have come here to follow up and see the quality of the job. We have already established that the quality was in line with what was designed and the purpose for which the project was begun in the first place&rdquo;.
&ldquo;By first quarter of 2020, we shall be having all the equipment ready so this place can be fully operational, because what the contractor is doing now is just the building. We are going to resource this place with the equipment and manpower that is required&rdquo; he said.
He stated that the meter testing station is the first building the agency is starting from the scratch and completing, noting that it has only had to renovate others that it took from the Power Holding Company of Nigeria, (PHCN).
On how the station is going to operate, he said &ldquo;it is not built and tied to capacity. The capacity is the human element. The machines that we are bringing are to carry out routine test of energy meters and as soon as it is operationalized, we begin daily operations&rdquo;.
Speaking further, he said &ldquo;If the number of meters explodes, it mean we shall increase our services, then we can have two shifts. If the need arises, depending on the size of meters, we can do three shifts because our services here will be demand driven&rdquo;
He also said that the station will have the inspectorate service which involves people that will function to inspect electrical installations because NEMSA is empowered to carry out inspection, testing and certification of any and all category of any installation before they start functioning&rdquo;.
He said that the arm of NIMSA which functions to enforce technical standards and regulation in the industry will also be on ground to ensure and maintain safety.
&ldquo;NIMSA&rsquo;s impact is huge in the industry. When you see bad network, it is our men that go round to ensure that everything is fixed. There are so many transformers that are not fit to be used in Nigeria&rdquo;. He said.
As part of its contribution towards ensuring safety of electricity users, Ewesor said that the agency has instructed instructed its men to destroy any infrastructure, building or premises built under power lines because it exposes humans to permanent radiation which affects the physiology of the body."

The tanker vassel is said to have lasted for over a year and four months.
According to the Swiss foreign ministry, it has since May 21 asked the international court in charge of the law of the sea to order Nigeria to release the tanker vassel, its crew and cargo
Report had it that thr tanker vassel was arrested for entering Nigerian waters illegally and trafficking in diesel.
The captain of the ship had denied the allegations, saying we had all papers covering him and the transactions.
Some crew members, except four Ukrainians had already been allowed to leave the ship which has the capacity for 5,500 tonnes of cargo.
The Swiss foreign ministry said the ship and the cargo had been losing their value ""causing increasing damage to the company involved."""
547,"Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, had warned a South West leader and national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to be careful in his political alliance with Fulani politicians.
He urged Tinubu to learn from history how every relationship any South West leader had with the Fulani in the past ended up.
There are speculations that Tinubu is nursing the ambition to succeed PresidentMuhammadu Buhari in 2023.
Fani-Kayode, apparently supposing that Tinubu wants to achieve his alleged aspiration using his present relationship with Buhari and other Fulani politicians wrote on his official Twitter handle:
&ldquo;Every single notable leader from the SW that formed an alliance with the Fulani ended up regretting it and paying a price.
&ldquo;From Afonja, to Akintola, to Fani-Kayode, to Awolowo (during the civil war) to Abiola, to Bola Ige and to Obasanjo.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Tinubu learn from history?&rdquo;"
548,"The Senate Leader, Ahmed Lawan, explained on Tuesday that the increasing number of out-of-school children in the country will continue to be a burden and a source of insecurity to Nigeria.
He raised a point of order during plenary where he said Nigerian children are not being given the kind of treatment they deserve.
According to him, education is compulsory for every Nigerian child and the government must do its best to see that this is accomplished.
A study by UNICEF shows that Nigeria has an estimated 13.2 million out-of-school children, the highest in the world. About 69 per cent of the country&rsquo;s out-of-school children are in the northern part of Nigeria.
Statistics from the study also showed that about 13 per cent of these children are in the FCT.
Of the 13.2 million children, 60 per cent of them are girls, many of who enroll in school but drop out along the line.
PREMIUM TIMES reported the high number of out-of-school children in some communities in the Federal Capital Territory.
Plenary
Speaking at the plenary, Mr Lawan urged his colleagues as well as the federal government to &ldquo;address the problem of children going to school.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We have the challenge of giving our children the kind of treatment that they deserve. Today we have over 14 million children out of school and 42 per cent of our population is between 0-17 years. And with the kind of treatment that we give to our children, this population will continue to be a burden and a source of insecurity to us.
&ldquo;The major source of insecurity is the neglected section of our society particularly children out of school. Our children of ages 14-18 have been found to be involved in insurgency and all manners of criminal activities including drug abuse.
&ldquo;Mr President, we legislated on the health sector by giving one per cent of the Consolidated Revenue Fund and today we are celebrating resources to develop our health sector.
&ldquo;I believe that the time has also come to give something significant to basic education and that captures right from kindergarten to junior secondary school education,&rdquo; he said.
The lawmaker referred to the Universal Basic Education (UBEC) Act 2014 which provides for compulsory, free universal basic education for all children of primary and junior secondary school age in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
He said it is time &ldquo;to walk the talk in the UBEC Act&rdquo;. He urged the next assembly to commit itself to ensuring that the basic education &ldquo;that is supposed to be free, is implemented to the latter.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The time has come for us in those states where the Almajiri system has been established for years, to consider and see how we can work out a system that will make the Almajiri system does not continue in the way that it is today.
&ldquo;We must be able to provide a conducive learning environment for them,&rdquo; he added.
In his remark, the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, said Nigeria celebrated Children&rsquo;s Day in a society &ldquo;where a large percentage of her children are still out of school&rdquo;.
He said the government is responsible for, not only ensuring that children are in school, but also to make it mandatory for parents to let kids go to school.
&ldquo;We have passed some bills to improve the funds for UBEC to reduce the percentage of contribution by states so that it is possible to access funds from UBEC.
&ldquo;A lot of work has to be done with the new governors coming, no matter what we do or say at the national level. We owe it a duty that in this area, there is a great improvement because unless we address the issues in the education sector, we would not prepare our children for the challenges ahead of them in the world.
&ldquo;Education is the greatest asset of any nation and that of our children. As we celebrate, we should remember our responsibilities as representatives of the people. We would do our best to make the future better for our children,&rdquo; he said."
549,"In efforts to end the ravaging insurgency in the country, troops of the Nigerian Army have killed scores of Boko Haram terrorists in northern Borno area.
A statement by army spokesperson, Col. Sagir Musa on Wednesday revealed that the terrorists were killed in an ambush the military laid on them upon intelligence gathered.
The statement also added that the troops recovered arms and ammunition from the terrorists.
Col. Musa said: &ldquo;Following credible information from good Samaritans of a planned terrorists attack on114 Task Force Battalion, E Company location at Izge village, Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State, troops of 143 Battalion laid an ambush on the terrorists&rsquo; withdrawal route along Kubu village on June 4, 2019.
&ldquo;Consequently, the terrorists entered the ambush, which resulted in the death of unconfirmed number of the criminals and the following items were recovered: four AK 47 rifles, one 81 Millimeter Mortar, assorted ammunition, two Hilux Vehicles and one Pumping Machine. There was no casualty on the part of the national army.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Army, through the Theatre Command of Operation Lafiya Dole uses this medium to commend and encourages those who availed the troops the information that led to the success of the operation, and further enjoined members of the public to be more forthcoming to the security agencies with useful information about the terrorists and other criminals in Nigeria.&rdquo;"
550,"The Nigerian Senate is pushing for a reform of the current model of the Almajiri education system in the North which has existed for over a century to create opportunity for the almajiris to acquire formal education.
The motion was moved Tuesday by Senate Leader Ahmad Lawan, representing Yobe North Senatorial district, who said the provisions of the Universal Basic Education Act, 2004, which made formal education compulsory for school age children, should be adhered to.
He said: &ldquo;The recruits are there. There are 17-year olds who are supposed to be in school but are roaming the streets.
&ldquo;Even though it is controversial, a time has come in those States where the Almajiri System is established for over 100 years to consider and see how we can work out a model that will ensure that the Almajiri System should not continue in the way and manner it is today.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I believe that this will be a major issue because we have to transform this sector if we want to ensure that these people contribute to national development and reduce the chances and risk of getting them recruited into insurgency and banditry,&rdquo; he added."
551,"Former President Goodluck Jonathan has again called for the implementation of the 2014 national conference.
Speaking at the public presentation of a book by Femi Okurounmu, a former senator, Jonathan said his administration inaugurated the national dialogue to reconcile ethnic differences, heal old wounds and promote peace.
The conference was chaired by late Idris Kutigi, former chief justice of Nigeria (CJN).
He said the implementation of the report will help the nation to make progress
&ldquo;The call for reforms has continued to grow louder, gathering the kind of momentum that should no longer be overlooked, if the nation must make real progress,&rdquo; the former president said.
&ldquo;I believe that the solutions to most of the problems we face today lie in our honest assessment of the recommendations of the 2014 national conference. If we take politics out of our consideration, there is every likelihood that a diligent implementation of the key recommendations of the conference will lead the nation out of the woods. This will heal frayed nerves, promote solidarity, engender peace and reposition our nation for meaningful growth and sustainable development.
&ldquo;The recommendations of the conference were far-reaching in setting an agenda for peace and unity. They amply captured the solutions to the problems of today and made suggestions that will address the worries of tomorrow.&rdquo;
The former president said his administration could not implement the recommendations of the conference because it did not have enough time to do so, as it was submitted less than a year to the end of his tenure.
&ldquo;Then, the members of the national assembly, whose duty it was to consider and validate the process, were preoccupied with the battle for political survival,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I believed that given the nature of the consultations and due deliberations involved in advancing the process, an orderly and systematic implementation could not have been conducted in less than one year.
&ldquo;It was obvious we did not have that time before the end of my administration. I did not insist on a rushed implementation because my administration did not embark on the conference to achieve political popularity but to genuinely advance the course of nation-building.
&ldquo;We assembled 492 reputable individuals, drawn from all walks of lives and shades of opinion, who emerged through a rigorous selection process, to conduct diligent deliberations over a period of 120 days. We did this not to score a political point, but to come up with ideas on how to strengthen the pillars of our democracy and build a new foundation for sustainable nationhood.&rdquo;"
552,"Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has sent an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari ahead of his inauguration for second term in office, urging him to &ldquo;publicly commit to making every day of your stay in Aso Rock a 'Rule of Law' Day, including by ensuring that every segment of your government&rsquo;s daily operations is lawful and rule-of-law compliant, for the sake of fairness, justice, your legacy, and the success of your anti-corruption agenda, which has remained stuck in limbo.&rdquo;
The organization expressed: &ldquo;serious concerns that the results of the &lsquo;rule of law MOT&rsquo; in the past four years are uniquely damaging to your government&rsquo;s fight against corruption and to the country.&rdquo;
In a letter dated 29 May 2019 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organization said: &ldquo;Making a public commitment to dedicate every day of your second term as a &lsquo;Rule of Law&rsquo; day will help to ensure that decisions of our courts are fully obeyed, refocus, improve and reinforce the anti-corruption agenda. It will also serve as a reminder that no one has immunity from the law, not even the government.&rdquo;
The organization said: &ldquo;The deficits in the rule of law have been particularly notable in three areas: failure to obey decisions of Nigerian courts,failure to push for transparency in asset declarations by high-ranking public officials and failure to push for unexplained wealth orders against former presidents and former governors and other senior public officials suspected of living on proceeds of corruption and &lsquo;dirty money&rsquo;.&rdquo;
The letter read in part: &ldquo;We urge you to use the opportunity of your second term to begin to implement your oft-expressed commitment to the rule of law by immediately obeying decisions of Nigerian courts, promoting transparency in asset declarations by publishing widely details of your assets declaration, encouraging Vice-President Professor Yemi Osinbajo to do the same, and instructing all your ministers to publish their asset declarations.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We also urge you to immediately instruct your next Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to pursue unexplained wealth court orders against all former presidents (and their estates), former governors, former presidents of the Senate and former speakers of the House of Representatives aimed at forcing those of them suspected of living on proceeds of corruption and&lsquo;dirty money&rsquo; to reveal sources of their fortune or risk forfeiting it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nigeria&rsquo;s democracy ought to have as its foundation respect for human rights and the rule of law. Treating the decisions of Nigerian courts as not binding is antithetical to any contemporary notion of the rule of law and democracy, and clearly counter-productive to the fight against corruption.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ignoring or refusing to obey decisions of our courts is implicitly rendering the judiciary powerless to enforce constitutional and legal rights, violating separation of powers, undermining the rule of law, and ultimately, raising serious question marks on the government&rsquo;s commitment to fight grand corruption.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Democracy is an inherent element of the rule of law, and obeying decisions of the courts, pushing for transparency of high-ranking government officials and going after former senior officials suspected of living on proceeds of corruption and &lsquo;dirty money&rsquo; are closely connected with the existence and consolidation of democracy, good governance and development.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Persistent disobedience of decisions of our courts by the government has opened the way for many state governors to do the same within their states including by using anti-media laws to suppress the civic space, target journalists and human rights defenders, grant to themselves pensions for life and commit grand corruption and other appalling atrocities.&rdquo;
&ldquo;High-profile judgments your government is refusing to obey include at least two judgments obtained by SERAP. The first is the judgment by Justice Hadiza Rabiu Shagari ordering the government to tell Nigerians about the stolen asset it allegedly recovered, with details of the amounts recovered. The second judgment, by Justice Mohammed Idris, ordered the government to publish details on the spending of stolen funds recovered by successive governments since the return of democracy in 1999.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Another court order that is yet to be complied with is the order for the release of Islamic Movement of Nigeria leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenah, from unlawful detention, obtained by human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana.&rdquo;"
553,"The Igbo Socio- cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has come hard on the Federal Government for its inability to deal with the lingering security challenge facing the country.

Arising from its monthly meeting which held in Enugu, the National Executive Committee of the organization also condemned the reported ongoing negotiation between the Federal Government and Miyetti Allah to give them a grant of N100 Billion as a reaction to the grave security threats.

In a statement signed by its president General, Nnia Nwodo, the organization stated that there have been increased state of insecurity such as killings, kidnappings and various forms of banditory in the country in the last few months.

The organization regretted that In parts of the Middle Belt, Militant Herdsmen have continued to kill, main and distabilize Christian areas with very little containment by the National Security Forces.

""What is most disturbing Is that very few arrests, seizures of arms or prosecution have been made in all these instances by our national security forces and the impression is created that their activities have the encouragement, sanction and acquiescence of our national security"". It said.

It further regretted that several local and international mining companies have without license, occupied parts of Northern Nigeria and engaged in continuous illegal mining of Nigeria's mineral resources.

It stated that In the South East and South West, collosal ransoms are daily extorted from helpless citizens by kidnappers and many captives killed by bandits, making it impossible for locals to freely move about.

""Why on earth these gun trotting militants should be protected financially an insulated from criminal prosecution whilst IPOB, an armless group is proscribed and categorised as dangerous to National security bugs our imagination"" it said.

The organization reiterated that as long as the persisting situation subsists, the only national solution to it is for the country to be restructure."
554,"The National Communications Communications, NCC has organized a workshop to better educate judges on the emerging legal and regulatory issues in telecommunications.
Speaking during the opening ceremony of the two-day workshop in Enugu, the Executive Vice Chairman of the NCC, Umar Danbatta said that technological advancements in the digital age have entrenched the role of telecommunications in every facet of daily interactions and transactions which are without legal significance.
Danbatta who was represented by the Executive Commissioner, Stakeholders Management of the NCC, Sunday Dare said that dependence on telecommunications as the platform for driving digital and financial inclusion has resulted in the collection of a large amount of personal data for Nigerian.
""It is for this reason that the workshop seeks to explore issues of privacy,national security, admissibility of digital evidence and cross border transfer of data"" he said.
He stated that the workshop will also delve into bank fraud perpetrated via telecommunication infrastructure platform.
Noting that there are some apprehension among the general populace regarding the health risk associated with the siting of telecommunication infrastructure in residential areas, he said the workshop will also discuss the effects of Electromagnetic fields radiation on human health.
Also speaking during the event,the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Ibrahim Muhammad said that the shift from traditional means of communication and the entry of multiple internet and service providers as well as satellite operators has given rise to a broader influence of telecommunications in the world.
Muhammad who was represented byMary Odili of the supreme court, noted that the unprecedented surge in technological innovations has birthed grave concerns like electronic banking fraud and other issues arising from e-transactions.
""This therefore makes it imperative to continuosly update judicial officers with necessary expertise knowledge and skills to help them adjudicate in case bordering on legal and regulatory issues in telecommunications"" he said.
He noted that the outcome of the discussions will enable the NCC meet up with its commitment to an improved environment for telecommunication services.
Also speaking during the event, the Administrator of the National Judicial Institute, NJI,R.P.I Bozimo said that a number of legal and regulatory challenges such as cybercrimes and the growing need for censorship and data protection are increasingly confronting policy makers and the regulators.
He stated that some of the issues will be instituted in courts which is exactly why the workshop has been put in place to shed light on how the issues can be adjudicated upon she they arise.

555,"Pro-south socio-cultural organisation Ohanaeze Ndigbo has advised the Federal Government to use the famed Sambisa forest, for the now suspended controversial Ruga settlement programme.
The group in a statement issued on Friday through its national publicity secretary, Uche Opaga- Achi noted that Sambisa forest will be ideal because the land mass in the north, is by far much more larger than the one in the east or in south.
Ohaneze also kicked against the push by Northern leaders under the umbrella of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), to immediately implement the setting up of Fulani herdsmen settlements popularly known as Ruga.
According to the national publicity secretary of Ohaneze, the positions of both ACF and the youth coalition, show the level of impunity they demonstrate or operate.
&ldquo;Nigeria is already on fire, and what was remaining is disintegration, which the action of these people is leading to. They are mongering for war; the country is on fire, there is distress everywhere. It is turning to criminality and absurdity that people will stay in the comfort of their homes and dictate what happens in another zone.
&ldquo;What is the concept of rule of law and human rights; what is the concept of self determination; what is the concept of government protecting lives and property of people under its watch? They have the backing of the federal government and that is the more reason they can just wake up in the morning and begin to say things that are capable of disintegrating the country and nobody cares and they get out of it and lie freely on their beds, while the statement they have made is enforcing, heating the embers of disunity in the country.
&ldquo;Our argument is this, the land in the north is by far much more larger than the one in the east or in south. Why is it that it is in the east and south that they are making emphasis of enforcing Ruga? Our argument is that you have the Sambisa forest that can contain all the cows in Africa and the insurgents are coming in through that axis. Let them go and develop the forest and bring all the cows in Africa and put there. They will be free from all forms of destruction, distraction or problems here and there; there will be no farmers there to clash with.
&ldquo;In the alternative, the Sahara desert is wasting; you have oil in the south and you piped it to the north and you use it the way you want. So, the same way, you can also pipe water to the Sahara desert, as Governor Nyesom Wike suggested that they can pipe water to the desert, and Governor Dave Umahi also said that they can buy the grasses from the south. So, you can use the money you have and pipe water to develop the Sahara desert, water it and grass it.
&ldquo;The cows will have a field day; the herders will have nobody to clash with. How come that you want to stifle the people with the little land they have here. You see brothers and sisters fighting over land because the land is too small; there are so many land cases in the court, which tells you that land is not even here, and you want to bring in Fulani from all parts of Africa to come and flood here in order to continue with you Islamisation and Fulanisation agenda. Is there anything hidden about this thing; it is an open secret.
&ldquo;The support of the coalition group on herdsmen being part of security in states, is as laughable and as it is provocative and even insulting. How can southerners go to north and constitute vigilante? What is the job of the police, what is the job of the local vigilante there, are you saying that they are incompetent? They are doing their jobs. See how Boko Haram is killing our soldiers because the government provides money for arms and ammunition, but the people at the helm of affairs allegedly pocket the money.
&ldquo;People are calling that Ruga should be implemented when the federal government has made a statement suspending it. Is that not a counter action, which is an offence and more so, criminal when you are making statements or comments capable of tearing the country into pieces, and yet, nobody is going for them; herdsmen are killing and raping people, and nobody is arresting them.
&ldquo;They have a field day. It is the IPOB whose members were not armed was declared a terrorist group, but the terrorists that are busy killing people, damaging farms are walking freely without challenge. So, why will the northern youth not make inflammatory statement when they knew that nobody would question them and they have the backing of their elders.&rdquo;"
556,"The governors of the 36 states of the federation will Friday in Abuja meet with President Muhammadu Buhari to consider steps to tackle the worsening insecurity in the country.
Criminals have dominated the nation&rsquo;s landscape in recent times, engaging in banditry, kidnappings and farm rustling even as herdsmen have run riot across the country, maiming and killing farmers.
The new wave of crime has aggravated the nation&rsquo;s security already convulsed by Boko Haram insurgency.
Today&rsquo;s meeting, with the president presiding, will also discuss debts inherited by the governors, which they claimed would make governance difficult in their respective states.
Data from the Debt Management Office put sub-national debts at N5.376 trillion, as at December 2018, with Lagos&rsquo; over N1 trillion debt stocks topping the list.
The meeting, a governor said, followed a resolution of the governors during their first meeting after the election of Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, as the chairman of the Nigerian Governors&rsquo; Forum (NGF).
According to the governor, &ldquo;This meeting is our first meeting with the President and Commander-in-Chief since our inauguration on May 29. It is basically on the worrisome state of insecurity in the country. He is the Commander-in-Chief. We are expected to present our findings on the state of insecurity in our respective states. The state of kidnapping and all sorts of violence is becoming worrisome.
&ldquo;Also, most of us met several degrees of empty treasury when we assumed office on May 29. We met huge debts and backlog of unpaid salaries. Some of us may be asking for some sort of financial bailout from the federal government to enable the states to ensure good governance.&rdquo;
However, the 15 governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) were expected to hold a pre-general meeting to harmonise their positions ahead of the gathering with the president today.
A statement by the Coordinator, PDP Governors&rsquo; Forum, Chief Osaro Onaiwu, said the PDP governors would be hosted by Bayelsa State Governor, Hon. Seriake Dickson, who doubles as the chairman of the PDP Governors&rsquo; Forum, at the state Governor&rsquo;s Lodge in Abuja.
Apart from adopting a common ground on their meeting with Buhari, the PDP governors would also discuss the party&rsquo;s position on the forthcoming June 11 election of the principal officers of the Ninth National Assembly.
The PDP governors&rsquo; intervention might not be unconnected with the divided positions of the PDP National Assembly members-elect.
It was gathered that for divergent reasons, the party&rsquo;s federal lawmakers-elect might not ensure a block vote for the party&rsquo;s choice of presiding officers.
The PDP National Assembly caucus is expected to meet Friday night to harmonise their positions for the voting on Tuesday."
561,"The Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON), Mr. Osita Okechukwu, has stated that the final report for the 2019 general election presented by the European Union has vindicated the position held by the All Progressives Congress (APC) that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) did not generate results for the general election from server.
Speaking to journalists in Enugu yesterday, Okechukwu said it was satisfying to hear the EU Mission in Nigeria state that it was unaware of an INEC server by which results were transmitted during the election.
He said that what was most amazing was how the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) canvassed that in one breath , INEC conducted elections transparently in Adamawa, Bauchi, Imo, Oyo, Zamfara states, where they won and in another breadth manipulated the results in the axis where it lost.
According to him, &ldquo;We had maintained that its trite in law that one cannot build something out of nothing; Accordingly, we agree with EU Election Observer Mission denial of knowledge of the existence of the so-called server used by INEC to conduct 2019 general election.&rdquo;
He maintained that it was completely wrong to gloss over the truism that President Muhammadu Buhari has a 12 million vote-bank, which had been on display in 2003, 2007, 20011, 2015 and 2019 presidential elections&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The hard fact is that President Buhari has cult followership, which is only comparable to that of Malam Aminu Kano or Sir Ahmadu Bello, Sarduna of Sokoto, both of blessed memory, in the North. Nobody can erase this hard fact,&rdquo;he said.
On the report where the EU Election Observer Mission pointed out systemic failings witnessed in the elections and the relatively low levels of voter participation, he said the president will work with all Nigerian citizens, state institutions, civil society, the media and other experts to make sure that there will be proper electoral reforms
He called on INEC to commence the introduction of e-Voting in the off-cycle state elections, as preparatory ground for full implementation of Electronic Voting.
&ldquo;We must remind ourselves that there was a time when one eminent citizen said that telephone is not for the poor, but today the groundnut hawker in his village has smart phone. We must commence e-Voting as a matter of urgent national importance,&rdquo; he said."
562,"The federal government has issued a warning to Ghana and Togo to stop attacking Nigerians in their countries.
The Chairman of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Mrs. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, made this known while addressing journalists after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa in Abuja.
She said the warning became necessary following the recent attacks on Nigerians residing in those countries.
Dabiri-Erewa called on the foreign countries to protect Nigerians the same way the lives of their nationals are being safeguarded in Nigeria.
&ldquo;Right now, we are dealing with the issue of attacking Nigerian traders in Ghana. We have the assurances of the President of Ghana through the high commission here and ours in Ghana that Nigerian traders will be protected,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;So, we are also going to be emphasising that the life of one Nigerian means a lot to us anywhere in the world.
&ldquo;Of course we have the issue of Ghana, the professor whose appointment was terminated by his university because of the tape he released. Well, it turned out that he didn&rsquo;t actually record, I mean that was a private meeting with Nigerians in Ghana, it was like a private discussion.
&ldquo;And he also claimed that part of the tape was actually doctored. The matter is being looked into by the Nigeria High Commission in Ghana and I believed those matters will be resolved subsequently.&rdquo;
Dabiri-Erewa said the Togolese Ambassador has been contacted on the issues of attacks on Nigerians in the country.
&ldquo;And the issues happening around neighbouring countries like Togo &ndash; in Togo, we have Nigerians attacked,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;We have also seen the Togolese Ambassador and made it clear that the lives of Nigerians must be protected anywhere they are because we take care of others here and we deserve to be taken care of.
&ldquo;If a Nigerian commits a crime, let him pay the penalty for it as a punishment, but you cannot penalise a nation and its citizens.
&ldquo;So, we will be working more on that as we appealed to Nigerians to be good ambassadors wherever they find themselves,&rdquo; she explained.
Speaking on the case of vandalism in the UK, where a Nigerian damaged some vehicles at the high commission, she said there will be a stakeholders&rsquo; meeting between the Nigerian community in the UK, the high commission, and the immigration unit.
&ldquo;So, we will be engaging more with the diaspora. Subsequently, we are going to have hotlines for Nigerians in diaspora so that they can contact the commission and we can look into whatever challenges they are facing,&rdquo; she said."
563,"Strong indications have emerged that a combination of grudge by senior officers against the continued stay in office of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, unresolved welfare issues and outstanding payments and entitlement to the families of some fallen men and officers and the activities of fifth columnists have contributed to the sabotaging of the ground war against insurgency.
This is coming as the Nigerian Army over the weekend thwarted an ambush staged by insurgents in the North-east, provoking a fierce exchange of fire that led to the killing of two terrorists even as it arrested a kidnap kingpin and 20 armed bandits terrorising villages in Katsina State.
Buratai,had, in a recent workshop in Abuja, hit back at those sabotaging the war efforts.
But media reports suggest that the continued stay in office of the army chief was creating crisis of confidence in the army and within the theatre of war even as senior officers close to Buratai have raised the charge that officers and men at the theatre of war create the impression oftotal commitment each time Buratai was in Maiduguri to boost the morale of fighters but soon reverts back to sabotage mode as soon as he moves back to Abuja.
Competent military sources disclosed that senior officers were not forthcoming with supportive ideas on how to win the war but rely only on orders issued by Army Headquarters even when they have better strategies and when prodded for contributions preferred to go with Buratai&rsquo;s war strategy knowing it may be faulty and would lead to a backlash.
It was further gathered that there were fifth columnists in the war theatre who have turned the campaign into a booming business by offering information to terrorists and their sponsors on the location of arms and ammunition each time there are new purchases of military hardware by the army.
Such profiteers are allegedly paid in hard currency.
These elements were believed to be responsible for the successful attacks and overrunning of four military bases within two months that lead to the killing ofthe Commanding Officer of 158 Battalion, Lt. Col. Azubuike and 25 soldiers, the latest being in Kareto village, 130 kilometres from Maiduguri, Borno State capital.
The insurgents usually carted away arms and ammunition, including tanks but the army recovered some of the weapons in subsequent encounters.
Media reports gathered show that the Nigerian Army has made purchases of military hardware four times in the last seven months from European countries, the last one in May being Czechoslovakiabut the type of hardware procured were not usually made available for security reasons.
&ldquo;The issue is that the COAS has brought it to the fore and we have said it repeatedly that great leaders without waiting for even the president to appoint new service chiefs could step down when you know your colleagues have lost confidence in you but cannot tell you so.
&ldquo;This is also the same with the other service chiefs. If your stay begins to hurt your colleagues and end in their premature retirement, must you wait for the C-in-C to retire you? This bothers on greed and with such a situation, this war is unwinnable,&rdquo; the source said.
Another military source was supportive of Buratai. &ldquo;The saboteurs are in the habit of showing so much commitment each time COAS is in the frontline. He has fought physically and I mean carrying AK 47 in the battlefield which greatly boosted the morale of the troops. And this has happened several times. Those who are asking him to resign, would they have resigned? When an army chief or any other service chief resigns in the middle of a war that means you have been defeated.
&ldquo;If the president has not asked you to go, how on earth can you go? Then you are not a trained soldier. Can an army chief resign when you are fighting terrorists? Buratai&rsquo;s time has been the best for the army in terms of welfare, provision of accommodation and improvement in remuneration even for retirees. When you are sabotaged as an army chief, you are fighting two wars and you can&rsquo;t give up&rdquo;, the source, who spoke anonymously, contended.
The issue of remuneration of men and officers are also part of the mix.
Some soldiers who survived some of the attacks on military bases and were later redeployed to other battalions have alleged that some of their salaries were stopped and have not been paid since the attacks.
There are also complaints by some wives of fallen soldiers in that regard but the army has since debunked the allegations, saying it was meeting obligations in terms of remunerations.
When contacted Army spokesman, Col. Sagir Musa, said the Nigerian Army stood by Buratai&rsquo;s speech and position on insufficient commitment of men and officers in the frontline.
&ldquo;Irrespective of whatever anybody said or will say, the Nigerian Army stands totally with the speech of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General T.Y Buratai,&rdquo; he said.
Meanwhile, the Nigerian Army said weekend it killed two terrorists, captured a kidnap kingpin and 20 other armed bandits terrorising villages in Katsina State.
A statement by the Army spokesman said: &ldquo;In its routine effort in providing andmaintaining a secure, and steady passage of persons and goods as well as free vehicular movements along some notable roads/main Supply Routes (MSR) in the North East, troops of 26 Brigade Garrisonon patrol and escort duties of civilian merchants and commuters along Wala village and adjoining communities on Saturday, the 22nd of June 2019, had a fierce encounter with desperate terrorists&rsquo; ambush team desperately craving for food and other essentials.&rdquo;
During the encounter, he said, troopsswiftly responded with heavy gunfire, thwarted the ambush, exterminated two terrorists and captured two AK 47 Rifles.
&ldquo;Subsequently, intelligence revealed that the terrorists were informed by their informants of the troops movement in order to use the opportunity to grab foodstuff that they direly need for survival. In order to consolidate on the gains achieved from the ambush clearance, further exploitation of the general area and beyond was undertaken with the troops of 121 Task Force Battalion dispatched to reinforce the 26 Brigade Garrison,&rdquo; he said.
Col. Musa noted that &ldquo;during advance, troops discovered two Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) concealed along their axis of advance. The IEDs were successfully detonated and cleared. Despite the IED threat, the resilient troops proceeded further to ensure the general area iscleared of terrorists and explosives. There is no casualty on the part of Nigerian Army troops during the operation.&rdquo;
He said the exploits in the ongoing operation &ldquo;Halaka Dodo&rdquo; was yielding success, noting that Acting General Officer Commanding (GOC) 7 Division Nigerian ArmyOperation Lafiya Dole, Brigadier General Abdulmalik Bulama Biu, on behalf of the Chief of Army Staff commended the troops for the successes achieved, and urged them to be more vigorous and decisive to end the insurgency.
He also conveyed the assurance of the unyielding support of the Chief of Army Staff in this regard.
In a related development, the army said it arrested a kidnap kingpin and 20 others terrorising villagers in Katsina State.
It said the suspects were arrested based on credible intelligence from the locals and confessions of the suspects showing their participation in several armed banditry activities.
&ldquo;In continuation of operations against armed banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and other criminalities in Katsina State, troops of 17 Brigade on Operation Harbin Kunama III, have arrested a notorious bandit/kidnapping kingpin, Mallam Bawa Gomna and 20 others during operations around Batsari, Jibia and Safana Local Government Areas of Katsina State between June 3 and 21, 2019.
&ldquo;Those arrested so far are reportedly responsible for terrorising villagers in Batsari, Jibia and Safana Local Government Areas of the state, an army statement said.
The release said the &ldquo;criminal elements were apprehended based on credible intelligence from the locals, and have confessed taking part in several banditry activities, cattle rustling and other sundry crimes. They, as usual, will be handed over to the respective law enforcement agency for further action.
&ldquo;The 17 Brigade Nigerian Army, commends and appreciates all those that provided the information that led to the arrest of the criminals and urged members of the public to continue to support security agencies with credible information in order to combat the insecurity&rdquo;.
Meanwhile, Buratai yesterday ordered commanders to fire officers and men who have shown unwillingness to fight terrorists.
He said at the closing ceremony of a workshop on transformational leadership for middle level officers in Abuja, that the Army would kick out those who are unwilling to lead or follow.
According to him, the Army will fish out the bad eggs in it and kick them out.
&ldquo;Let me now reiterate that in line with the theme of the workshop, the Nigerian Army will do all that is necessary to fish out any bad eggs whose willingness to lead or follow as required has waned.
&ldquo;Transformational leaders should not wait for them to get out of the way, you must kick them out of your way,&rdquo; he said.
He said the Army was ready to evolve and institutionalise formal mentoring frameworks to compliment the informal system that we currently practice.
&ldquo;I have ensured that we take advantage of technology as force multiplier in our operations. Yet I am glad that your discussions on emerging technologies and innovations made it clear that our human capacity and willingness to work is vital for success.
&ldquo;Lastly, the presentation on insights into the NA Strategic Plan 2019 &ndash; 2029 has given us hope that surely tomorrow will be better for the NA,&rdquo; he added."
564,"The Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) has resolved to set up a security committee at the National Economic Council level towards tackling the growing rate of insecurity across the country.The chairman of the forum, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state made this known late Wednesday while briefing newsmen in Abuja. Twenty two governors attended the NGF meeting. It is the second meeting under the new leadership, our reporter learnt.
According to Fayemi, the new leadership resolved to make security a reoccurring item on its agenda for the foreseeable future. &ldquo;Governors have decided to retain security as a growing concern and a permanent issue on its agenda,&rdquo; he said. 
He said state police was an issue of interest and concern to citizens and governors, adding that the forum would make its position known soon. 
He said the agenda of the new leadership also included human capital, job creation, constitutional reform particularly devolution, and strengthening of the forum&rsquo; s secretariat to support economic advisory, policy advisory , knowledge management and public financial management. 
Governor Fayemi said that members of the forum pledged to support the new leadership to promote collaboration and consensus among governors on matters of public policy. 
According to him, the forum would also re-launch its flagship State Review Mechanism programme designed to assist states foster good governance as well as accelerate the rate of development through periodic reviews of progress made by state governments. 
He said governors would be having a meeting with the World Bank and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on ongoing development engagements across states on June 26. &ldquo;The event will also host an IGR retreat with the Joint Tax Board and Chairmen of the Internal Revenue Service of states,&rdquo; he added. 
The governors also pledged to work with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) to strengthen investors&rsquo; engagements and promote strategic insights into states competitive advantages. 
The forum had earlier received a presentation on Sub-national Investment Promotion from Ms. Yewande Sadiku, Executive Secretary of the NIPC."
565,"Borno State governor, Babagana Zulum on Wednesday met President Muhammadu Buhari on the need to improve on security of the state.
Zulum who was in Aso villa, Abuja said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m basically here to discuss with Mr. President on how possible the Federal Government can strengthen the current security situation on the ground as well as strengthen the means of livelihood to the entire people of Borno State.
&ldquo;Basically, we want to address the root causes of the insurgency, especially the issue of access roads, access to farmlands and the issue of strengthening civilian JTF and the military to do their jobs better than before&rdquo;.
Speakung on the recent attacks in the state and what the government is doing to ensure the people sleep well at night, he said: &ldquo;The issue of security is not one you discuss anyhow. But the government of the state is collaborating with the military and other security agencies to ensure that the citizens are well-protected.
&ldquo;On my part, I am also trying to strengthen the locals to be resilient enough, especially by providing them with logistics like vehicles and others so that they can undertake some surveillance to support the military.
&ldquo;By and large, our discussions with the military have gone well and we are doing everything possible to ensure that stability returns to Borno State.&rdquo;
Asked if he was concerned thatBoko Haram insurgentswere no longer dealing with soft targets but attacking military bases, he said: &ldquo;You are aware that some incidents occurred two or three days ago where about 40 people were killed in Konduga. We are aware of steps the President is willing to take that will virtually bring that issue to a standstill.&rdquo;
He suggested other options apart from military force to end the insurgency.&ldquo;But most importantly, there is need for the Federal Government to also open other opportunities of bringing down the crisis rather than the kinetic force.
&ldquo;It is also important for those people who have been forced to join the insurgency, if they are integrated into the society. I think this will be good.
&ldquo;There is an existing policy within the military called operation safe corridor just to strengthen the system. We are optimism that Borno state will bounce back again.&rdquo; he said."

Trump&rsquo;s administration also reiterated that it is open to negotiating with the Islamic Republic without any preconditions.
According to media reports, the Iranian president while speaking on Tuesday at a press conference, accused the US of &ldquo;lying&rdquo; about wanting to resume talks between the two countries.
&ldquo;You say you really want to hold talks with us.&rdquo;

575,"Troops of the Nigerian Army attached to Operation Harbin Kunama 3 have arrested about 25 bandits while others were killed in gun battles in Sokoto and Katsina states communities.
According to the General Officer Commanding, GOC, 8 Division, Maj. Gen Hakeem Otiki, eight AK-47 rifles and 48 rounds of special ammunition were recovered from the bandits.

He said: &ldquo;The operation is to facilitate the return of refugees and internally displaced persons back to their homes, creating enabling environment for economic activities to strive and instill confidence in the locals to remain in their villages and continue their normal lives unmolested.&rdquo;"
570,"The Office of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Friday cautioned Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria on the claim that Osinbajo&rsquo;s office is in charge of implementing the Ruga settlement initiative across the country.
Recall that the General Secretary of MACBAN, Baba Uthman Ngelzarma, had said Osinbajo&rsquo;s office was in charge of implementing the programme nationwide.
He had said, &ldquo;This Ruga settlement model is a component part of the livestock development and transformation plan that is being implemented under the Office of the Vice-President. It is a component part of it.
&ldquo;All must agree with me that the crisis we are facing today has become a multi-dimensional one and so the approach must also be holistic. It was the desire of the Federal Government to take a holistic approach that gave birth to the Ruga settlement model and it is not only for Fulani herders.&rdquo;
But the Senior Special Assistant to the Vice-President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Laolu Akande, said in a tweet on Friday that the programme being handled by Osinbajo was different from the one being referred to by Miyetti Allah.
Akande clarified that the National Livestock Transformation Plan, which had been endorsed by the National Economic Council, was different from the Ruga programme.
He tweeted, &ldquo;Contrary to claims reported in sections of the media, Ruga settlements are not being supervised by the Office of the Vice President. Ruga is different from the National Livestock Transformation Plan approved by state governors under the auspices of the National Economic Council.
&ldquo;On the National Livestock Transformation Plan, 13 States are already in the process of implementation of a plan to transform the livestock production system in Nigeria along market-oriented value chain while ensuring an atmosphere of peace and justice.
&ldquo;The states are Adamawa, Benue, Kaduna, Plateau, Nasarawa, Taraba, Zamfara, Katsina, Kano, Kogi, Kwara, Ondo, and Edo. These states are at different stages in the process but have indicated readiness to implement the plan. Truth is: this Federal Government will not impose on any state government regarding its land.
&ldquo;NEC okayed the plan based on the recommendation of a technical committee of the council chaired by Ebonyi State Governor Umahi. Other state governors who were on the committee and working group are Adamawa, Kaduna, Benue, Taraba, Edo, Plateau, Oyo and Zamfara-mostly the frontline states.&rdquo;"
571,"President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday played host to the Nigerian-born president of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji, at the State House, Abuja.
During the meeting President Buhari revealed that Nigeria will continue to support the international court to ensure it fulfills its mandate.
According to Buhari, &ldquo;The ICC provides a moral strength for victims to receive justice against internal and external injustice.&rdquo;
The President&rsquo;s special adviser on media and publicity, Femi Adesina, who made the details of the meeting known in a statement, added that Buhari also called on developed countries to take the ICC &ldquo;more seriously in order to strengthen the rule of law and democracy.&rdquo;
Buhari had also during the meeting, the statement revealed, commended Judge Eboe-Osuji for the achievements of the ICC under his presidency.
Eboe-Osuji had earlier during their meeting congratulated Buhari on his re-election and successful inauguration for a second tenure.
He also appreciated Buhari for his &ldquo;strong and unambiguous statement in support of the rule of law&rdquo; and for the court and its principles during his visit to the headquarters of the ICC in The Hague last July.
The ICC President urged Buhari to maintain Nigeria&rsquo;s support for ICC and asked African leaders whose countries are yet to ratify the Rome Statute which established the court to do what is expected of them."
572,"The Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) has called on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government to allow their detained leader, Ibrahim Zakzaky and his wife, Malama Zeenah travel abroad for medical treatment.
According to Mikail Yunus, spokesman for the IMN in a statement on Wednesday, the appeal to allow their leader and wife to travel abroad for medical treatment is due to the &lsquo;deteriorating health&rsquo; condition of the pair who have both been held in detention since December 2015 by the Nigerian Government.
&ldquo;Based on reports, we wish to state that this is an urgent medical emergency, in every sense of the word. This is because it is clear that the very lives of Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky and Malama Zeenah Ibraheem are critically at risk and highly unstable,&rdquo; he said.
Yunus added, that the teams of physicians have already warned that the two may lose their lives if urgent medical treatment is not provided to them, hence the need for the medical emergency to be administered to them.
&ldquo;It is clear that all of the previously mentioned medical conditions have developed as a direct result of wanton negligence and untimely interventions, caused by the unnecessarily restricted nature of their access to medical attention for the past three years. We, therefore, find it atrocious that their health has been allowed to deteriorate in this manner,&rdquo; he said.
Yunus also added that Zakzaky and his wife urgently need to travel abroad for medical treatment adding that it is part of their right to life provided by the law.
&ldquo;This is a fundamental right of every citizen under section 33 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,1999 as amended and article 4 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, Cap.A10, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria (LFN), 2004,&rdquo; he said"
573,"As more controversies trail the planned establishment of rural grazing areas for herdsmen across the nation, the Presidency has stated that the RUGA settlement is meant to resolve farmer/herder conflicts.
In a statement on Sunday, signed by the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the Presidency clarified that the settlements are for animal herders who are not only Fulani.
The statement read: &ldquo;The presidency wishes to draw attention to recent unhelpful comments regarding the plan to stop roaming of cattle herders with the attendant clashes with farmers.
&ldquo;Ruga Settlement&rsquo; that seeks to settle migrant pastoral families simply means rural settlement in which animal farmers, not just cattle herders, will be settled in an organized place with provision of necessary and adequate basic amenities such as schools, hospitals, road networks, vetinary clinics, markets and manufacturing entities that will process and add value to meats and animal products.
&ldquo;Beneficiaries will include all persons in animal husbandry, not only Fulani herders.
&ldquo;The Federal Government is planning this in order to curb open grazing of animals that continue to pose security threats to farmers and herders.
&ldquo;The overall benefit to the nation includes a drastic reduction in conflicts between herders and farmers, a boost in animal protection complete with a value chain that will increase the quality and hygiene of livestock in terms of beef and milk production, increased quality of feeding and access to animal care and private sector participation in commercial pasture production by way of investments.
&ldquo;Other gains are job creation, access to credit facilities, security for pastoral families and curtailment of cattle rustling.
&ldquo;Stripped of the politics and howling that has attended the recent comments, there is no government plan to seize state land, colonize territory or impose Ruga on any part of the federation. Government has made it clear time and again that the programme is voluntary.
&ldquo;So far, twelve states have applied to the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, making lands available for the take-off of the scheme in their states. This number is sufficient for the pilot scheme.&ldquo;Unfortunately, some state governments that have not signified interest in the scheme and, therefore, are not on the invitation list have been misleading people that the Federal Government is embarking on a scheme to take away their lands.
&ldquo;Mostly, these are state leaders that have no explanation to offer their people for continued non-payment of workers&rsquo; salaries. It is true that government at the centre has gazetted lands in all states of the federation but because the idea is not to force this programme on anyone, the government has limited the take-off to the dozen states with valid requests.
&ldquo;We urge states to join the Federal Government at the centre in encouraging all sides to these conflicts to make efforts towards finding a peaceful resolution.
&ldquo;As we seek a permanent solution to these unwanted conflicts, efforts must be made to ensure that no innocent person faces any kind of deprivation or loss of right and freedom under our laws.&rdquo;"
574,"President Muhammadu Buhari has called on Heads of State and Government in the West African sub-region to tackle insecurity head-on.
He made the call at the 55th Summit of the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS held at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
He stated that a common strategy must be adopted by all member states at the national and regional level to combat insurgency, kidnapping, banditry and other forms of cross-border crimes.
Buhari stressed that until insecurity was addressed in the sub-region, its stability, economic prosperity and development would remain a mirage.
He said: &ldquo;Taking into account the transnational nature of the threats confronting us, the need for the adoption of a common strategy at the national and regional level to combat them, has become imperative.
&ldquo;By so doing, we will reinforce our actions and resources for a more effective response to protect our citizens and secure our common space.
&ldquo;While I acknowledge that several initiatives and measures have been taken in our respective countries recent developments have shown that we must cooperate more effectively to achieve our goals.
&ldquo;We should send a strong and unified message to the perpetrators of violence that we are resolute in our collective determination to confront and defeat them.&rdquo;
According to him, member states of the ECOWAS must remain focus in their collective endeavor in the areas of peace and stability so as to achieve the set goal of the organization.
He said the call had become imperative in view of the fact that despite the overall appreciable progress made, particularly in the field of political governance, the sub-region had continued to face considerable security challenges.
&ldquo;We are all witnesses to the recurring incidents of inter-communal clashes, herders-farmers conflicts, banditry and terrorist attacks in all our countries.
&ldquo;These threats, you will agree with me, have consequences on the peaceful co-existence between our communities and peoples as well as their livelihoods.
&ldquo;This unrest also undermines all our efforts in achieving full regional integration. It is, therefore, necessary that we act collectively to end this menace in the interest of regional stability and well-being of our people,&rdquo; he said."

576,"President Donald Trump and China&rsquo;s Xi Jinping agreed to another truce in their trade war on Saturday, removing an immediate threat looming over the global economy even as a lasting peace truce remains vague.
This was made during the annual summit of the Group of 20 nations which has entered its second and final day in Osaka, Japan.
The two sides have agreed to restart trade negotiations that broke down last month. The U.S. have also agreed to put no new tariffs on Chinese goods.
Trump said the U.S. would release a statement later on Saturday.
President Trump also said he and Turkish President Erdogan were trying to find solutions to Turkey&rsquo;s purchase of Russian made S-400 defence missiles, due to be delivered next month.

577,"Speaking on the proposed RUGA settlements, Nobel Laurette, Wole Soyinka, has noted that cattle must not take priority over human beings.
He cautioned that the implementation of ranching or any other initiative to solve the herders/farmers crisis should be done with humanity as a priority.
Soyinka made this comment while fielding questions from journalists about the recently proposed Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) initiative at an event on Tuesday.
According to him, the RUGA initiative is an explosive issue that needs to be handled carefully.
&ldquo;There cannot be any kind of society where cattle take priority over human beings,&rdquo; he said.
He also suggested that the ranching system can be adopted, however, it has to be done in an area that will have no negative impact on human lives.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing so strange or mysterious about cattle rearing so why should cattle become a problem just because we like to eat beef. I don&rsquo;t understand it, there are solutions which are very simple.
&ldquo;People have talked about ranching but the ranching has to be done in places that are environmentally congenial to that kind of trade and at the same time do not afflict humanity&rdquo;.
While lamenting that hundreds have been killed in farmer/herder clashes across the country, the Nobel Laureate blamed the situation on poor leadership.
&ldquo;People are being killed in hundreds till today and it&rsquo;s only because of the failure of the leadership at the critical time.
&ldquo;The cattle rearers have been given a sense of impunity, they kill without any compunction, they drive farmers who are contributing to the food solution of the country, burn and eat their crops and then you come with RUGA?&rdquo; he said."
578,"The Federal Government on Tuesday stepped down its plan on the proposed Ruga Programme.
An aide in the presidency who confirmed the development also said the Governors Forum will be speaking on the matter soon.
The planned Ruga initiative has been generating ripples across the country, as it was criticized as an agenda to saturate herdsmen across the country for ulterior motives.
But the presidency in its response, defended the controversial Ruga settlements programme saying that the initiative is for the benefit of all.
Recall that a statement released by the Senior Special Assistant to the President, Garba Shehu, maintained that the programme is not a scheme to reposition the Fulani people, adding that no state has been forced to partake of the initiative.
&ldquo;The Presidency wishes to draw attention to recent unhelpful comments regarding the plan to stop roaming of cattle herders with the attendant clashes with farmers.

579,"President Muhammadu Buhari has admitted that the performance of his administration in the power sector was &ldquo;not good enough.&rdquo;
He said that this called for more efforts by Electricity Distribution Companies to provide the needed resources and technical expertise
Buhari assured that his government would play its own part by improving the transmission of electricity.
The Nigerian leader stated in Abuja on Wednesday when the Oba of Benin, Omo N&rsquo;Oba N&rsquo; Edo Ewuare II, led members of the Edo State Council of Traditional Rulers and chiefs on a visit to the President at the Presidential Villa.
The Benin monarch, who sought Buhari&rsquo;s intervention on the poor power supply situation in Edo State, had described it as a &ldquo;pathetic situation.&rdquo;

The President, however, appealed to Nigerians for calm, while urging them to be patient with the Discos to deliver on their mandate.
A statement by the President&rsquo;s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, quoted him as saying that though his administration had put in its best to improve power in the past years, especially improvement in gas supplies, the performance was not good enough.
&ldquo;We are building infrastructure. We are doing our best, but, obviously, our best is not good enough yet&rdquo;, the Presidency quoted Buhari as saying.

Buhari praised the monarchs for their combined efforts in tackling trafficking in persons and rehabilitating the victims, who were repatriated back home.
&ldquo;I am pleased that you have taken up the fight against human trafficking and I know the effect of your intervention will be felt beyond our borders,&rdquo; the President told his visitors.
Buhari spoke on the Benin-Abuja Road project and his administration&rsquo;s efforts to develop the agricultural sector, &ldquo;promising that more will be done to diversify and strengthen the Nigerian economy.&rdquo;
Oba Ewuare II, while congratulating Buhari for winning a second term, prayed God to guide him in picking a formidable cabinet."
580,"The President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari has been queried by the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations (UN) for his inability to stem the high level of corruption, killings, and human rights violations among others in the country.
The accusations were contained in a report released at the conclusion of its review of the implementation of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in Nigeria.
During the meeting, Amb. Audu Ayinla Kadiri, Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations Office at Geneva, who led the Federal delegation was queried by the UN on the killings of members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) popularly, acknowledged and known as Shiites.
According to the UN Committee of Experts, Chaired by Ahmed Amin Fathalla, the purpose of the get together was to formulate recommendations aiming to help the Government to move forward in its fight against the aforementioned lapses by the government.
&ldquo;Human Rights Committee reviews the situation of Civil and Political Rights in Nigeria. The Human Rights Committee concluded today its review of the implementation of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in Nigeria,&rdquo; Ahmed Fathalla said.
The Committee of Experts also pointed out that corruption remained rampant and that implementation of the legislation was weak. They also asked the delegation to comment on recent events, notably the killing of people in Biafra region and the killing of 350 people in Zaria, in Kaduna province.
In his closing remarks, Ahmed Fathalla, Committee Chair, thanked the delegation. He also recalled that parties to international legal instruments had to abide by their obligations. &ldquo;It had been a fruitful debate,&rdquo; he stated.
In his opening remarks, Audu Kadiri said the composition of the Nigerian delegation was a testimony to its commitment to the implementation of the Covenant. He apologized for Nigeria&rsquo;s inability to submit its second periodic report.
He said Nigeria had implemented many initiatives to improve the effectiveness, accessibility, accountability, transparency and fairness of the justice system, such as the development of justice sector reform action plans and the establishment of judicial research and training centres.
Audu Kadiri added that the Nigerian Government was firmly committed to promote and protect the human rights of Nigerians noting that much had been done in that regard, across a broad range of fields, despite the fact that the Government acknowledged that challenges remained."
581,"The Nigeria Police Force has confirmed the arrest of forty members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) who were involved in the violent protest at the National Assembly on Tuesday in Abuja.
Members of the sect had marched to the National Assembly demanding the freedom of their leaderhad marched to the National Assembly demanding the freedom of their leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky who has been in custody since December 2015.
The protest, however, became violent after they were denied access to the assembly complex by security operatives.
The protesters allegedly shot two police officers, vandalised the gatehouse and also burnt three vehicles, destroying many others.
Abuja police spokesperson, Anjuguri Manzah, revealed in a statement that 40 Shiite protesters were arrested and that investigation ps had been launched into the matter.
The statement read: &ldquo;The FCT Police Command has foiled a violent move by members of the El-Zakzakky Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) to forcefully invade the National Assembly on Tuesday, 10th July, 2019.
&ldquo;The group which started its activity, camouflaged in a peaceful procession became violent and were trying to force their way into the National Assembly. Police operatives on the ground, however, acted proactively, professionally and used minimum force to disperse the unruly protesters.
&ldquo;Members of the sect during the violent protest shot two (2) police personnel on the leg, while clubs and stones were used to inflict injuries on six other policemen. The injured policemen have been taken to the hospital for prompt medical attention.
&ldquo;Meanwhile, forty (40) members of the sect have been arrested in connection with the violent protest. Investigation is in progress.
&ldquo;In view of the foregoing, the Command wishes to state unequivocally that while it recognizes and respects the right of citizens to peaceful procession, an attempt by any individual or group of persons to cause the breakdown of law and order will not be tolerated.
&ldquo;Those arrested in the process will be dealt with in accordance with the appropriate law of the land.
&ldquo;Members of the public are enjoined to go on with their lawful activities as normalcy has been restored, and adequate security measures have been emplaced by the Command to forestall any security breach.&rdquo;"
582,"South-East Governors have reacted to claims that they made secret donation of land for the controversial rural graving area (RUGA) project.
In a resolution issued by the Governors, signed by Prof Simon Uchenna Ortuanya, Director General, South East Governors&rsquo; Forum, they described the claims as spurious, cautioning against comments that could heat up the already charged polity.
The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Emma Powerful, claimed that two governors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the South East had concluded plans to hand over lands in some senatorial zones in their states to herdsmen.
According to IPOB, the plots by the governors were part of the now suspended Ruga programme, which was heavily kicked against by many southern and some middle-belt governors.
However, Ortuanya has clarified that no South East Governor has donated any land or intends to donate any land s for lack of enough land in the entire South East.
The Governors resolution reads: &ldquo;The attention of the South East Governors&rsquo; Forum has been drawn to the various attacks and campaign of calumny by our people alleging that Governors of South East have secretly donated land for RUGA Programme being promoted by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and the National Livestock Transformation Plan, (NLTP) as approved by the National Economic Council (NEC).
&ldquo;Governors of South East appreciate the fact that we have good and law abiding Herdsmen who have been living with us; some of them were even born here. We have been living in peace with them until recently when we started witnessing invasion of our land, kidnapping of our people, killing of defenseless natives and destruction of their farmlands.
&ldquo;These herdsmen that have been living peacefully with us together with the natives have insisted that these evil as now experienced in our land are the handiwork of herdsmen moving from other states into South East and most of the time, these herdsmen are not even Nigerians.
&ldquo;That, we will not chase away Herdsmen who are peaceful and have been living peacefully with us in the South East.
&ldquo;That we agreed with Herdsmen living peacefully with us and the natives that movement of cows into the South East should be by road transportation using trailers to their specific cow markets.
&ldquo;No more allowing foreign Herdsmen to move their cattle by foot as this is the point of conflict with the farmers and natives.
&ldquo;That we do not have any land to donate for RUGA or NLTP programmes but we are committed to selling grasses and by-product of our farms to support NLTP for states that have keyed into the programme.
&ldquo;That we believe that our brothers and sisters who are Herdsmen deserve a better life and we commend Mr. President and Vice President for their good intentions in this direction. However, it must be emphasized that what Federal Government and NEC approved was NLTP and it is not compulsory for all the states BUT FOR ANY WILLING STATE WHO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN NLTP.
&ldquo;We advise our kinsmen, women and indeed all Nigerians to please be careful with comments not to heat up the already charged state of Nigeria in this regard.
&ldquo;The wisdom of economics allows states to develop along the lines of their economic comparative advantage. In this direction, we advise the FGN to immediately start the implementation of NLTP in the Northern States that have accepted the Programme and where we have large expanse of land.
&ldquo;This will surly stop the movement of cows from one state to the other and put a stop to the crisis and suspicion between farmers and herdsmen. The objective and success of this programme must be viewed along the lines of conflict resolution, welfare for herders, peaceful co-existence among farmers and herders, rehabilitation and reintegration of the displaced farmers/ herders and natives and increase in the wealth of herders, farmers and the nation at large.
&ldquo;We ask all our people living outside the South East especially in the North to ignore the threat contained in the video message by self-styled Northern Youths. We are in talks with the Northern Governors and their leaders who speak for their people and they have assured us that there is no harm that will befall our people living in various Northern states across Nigeria.
&ldquo;Finally, we advise those drumming for war to remember our mothers and children and have a rethink. In a state of war, even your friends could become your enemies. Let us bond together as one people and start to think on how to rebuild our youths whose future we ate up in the time past, rebuild our nation whose patriotism we ignored in the time past and love one another.&rdquo;"
583,"The Northern Elders Forum, NEF, on Friday demanded that the Federal Governnment come up with policies that will end the problem of Fulani harassment.
The NEF also asked the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) to exercise restraint over its insistence on the implementation of the Ruga settlement scheme by the Federal Government, asking it not to take any further action in view of the involvement of northern governors and other respected Nigerians.
The NEF said this in a statement by it&rsquo;s Deputy Convener, Amb. Yahaya Kwande, adding that they would discuss with the CNG, Governors&rsquo; Forum and any Nigerian out for genuine solutions to the problems being faced by northern communities and the livestock industry.
The statement read in part: &ldquo;Most Nigerians recognise the genuine grounds for raising serious grievances in the light of provocations and apparent lack of sensitivity to a matter that affects the North and indeed the rest of Nigeria in a most critical manner.
&ldquo;Federal and state governments must adopt policies and positions which address the harassment of Fulani and their cattle, de-escalation of inciting rhetoric and actions and short and long-term solutions to the problems which could damage the livestock industry, worsen community relations and threaten national security.&rdquo;"
584,"A new report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes has revealed that about 64,000 Nigerians are murdered annually in the country.
The report also stated that the homicide rate is highest in the Northeast at 79 and North-Central at 65 per 100,000 inhabitants while the South-West had the lowest homicide rate at 4.4 victims per 100,000 persons.
According to the report titled Global Study on Homicide 2019, which was published on Monday, the drivers of homicide include inequality, unemployment, political instability, prevalence of gender stereotypes in the society and organised crime.
The study explained that the figure on the homicides in Nigeria was based on a survey conducted in partnership with the National Bureau of Statistics of Nigeria in 2016, covering more than 33,000 households in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.
It observed that the results of the survey provided strong evidence that the level of lethal violence in Nigeria could be significantly higher than reported to the authorities or estimated based on public health data.
The report stated: &ldquo;On the basis of the survey sample, the annual homicide rate of Nigeria in the period 2013&ndash;2016 was estimated at 34 per 100,000 population, corresponding to around 64,000 victims of intentional homicide annually with significant variations across the six geopolitical zones.
&ldquo;The total homicide rate was estimated to be the highest in the North-East: 79 per 100,000 population and North-Central: 65 per 100.000. With an estimated 4.4 victims of homicide per 100.000 inhabitants, the homicide rate was the lowest in the South-West.&rdquo;
The UNODC Communications Officer, Sylvester Atere, in a statement on Tuesday, quoted the UNODC Executive Director, Yury Fedotov, as saying the Global Study on Homicide &ldquo;seeks to shed light on gender-related killings, lethal gang violence and other challenges, to support prevention and interventions to bring down homicide rates&rdquo;.
Fedotov added: &ldquo;Countries have committed to targets under the Sustainable Development Goals to reduce all forms of violence and related death rates by 2030. This report offers important examples of effective community-based interventions that have helped to bring about improvements in areas afflicted by violence, gangs and organised crime.&rdquo;"

Amnesty International alsoblastedPhilippine police abuses after as former top enforcer defended recent deadly raids which has claimed thousands of casualties especially in Manila, the Philippines&rsquo; capital.
The human rights group said extrajudicial executions by police remain &ldquo;rampant&rdquo;, and the scale of abuses has already reached &ldquo;the threshold of crimes against humanity&rdquo;.
On Monday, Amnesty said its latest investigation showed police operate with &ldquo;total impunity as they murder people from poor neighbourhoods whose names appear on manufactured &lsquo;drug watch lists&rsquo; established outside of any legal process.&rdquo;

In a letter to Simon McDonald, the most senior official at the Foreign Office, Darroch said the row, in which Trump has called the ambassador &ldquo;a pompous fool&rdquo; and &ldquo;very stupid&rdquo;, meant he could not continue.
&ldquo;Since the leak of official documents from this embassy there has been a great deal of speculation surrounding my position and the duration of my remaining term as ambassador,&rdquo;he wrote.
&ldquo;I want to put an end to that speculation. The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like&rdquo;, he said.
In response to Darroch&rsquo;s letter, McDonald said that he accepted the resignation with &ldquo;deep personal regret&rdquo; and praised him for behaving throughout the controversy &ldquo;as you have always behaved over a long and distinguished career, with dignity, professionalism and class&rdquo;.
McDonald added: &ldquo;The prime minister, foreign secretary and whole of the public service have stood with you: you were the target of a malicious leak; you were simply doing your job. I understand your wish to relieve the pressure on your family and your colleagues at the embassy; I admire the fact that you think more of others than yourself.&rdquo;

She added: &ldquo;We owe him an enormous debt of gratitude. I hope the house will reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles particularly when they are under pressure.&rdquo;
The confidential memos from Kim Darroch leaked to the Daily Mail newspaper that annoyed the US president and embarrassed London, quoted the UK ambassador to have said Trump&rsquo;s presidency could crash and burn, ending in disgrace according to a cache of secret cables and briefing notes sent back to Britain.
The paper said the most damning comments by Darroch described Trump, who was received by Queen Elizabeth II during a state visit to Britain just last month, as insecure and incompetent."
588,"Vice President Yemi Osinbajo wednesday charged military officers and men to be ready always to defend Nigeria with their lives.
Osinbajo, who served as the reviewing officer at the passing out parade of the Direct Short Service Course 28 of 2019 comprising 187 new officers, held at the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Base in Kaduna, described military career, which is to defend the territorial integrity of the country, as the most civic service.
According to him, beyond earning salary and getting a chance to wear a coveted uniform, the military should put their lives on the line for the safety and welfare of Nigerians.
He, however, told the new military officers that Nigeria was still grappling with insurgency in the North-east, and kidnapping and banditry in other parts of the country.
The vice president said given the security challenges confronting the nation, the new officers would soon be busy by fulfilling their responsibilities to the military and the country.
He said: &ldquo;As you already know, this profession you have chosen requires absolute discipline, loyalty and hard work. It is much more than just securing a job, or earning a salary; and more than just getting the chance to wear a coveted uniform or wield coveted weapons. This is the ultimate form of civic service to defend the territorial integrity of your country and to put your life on the line for the safety and welfare of millions of your countrymen and women. There is no nobler occupation than this one you have chosen.
&ldquo;You are passing out at a time when our nation is grappling with an insurgency in the North-east, and the challenges of kidnapping and banditry in other parts of the country. You will, therefore, have come to terms with the fact that the days and weeks and months ahead of you will be extremely busy, as you fulfil your responsibilities to the military and the nation.
&ldquo;While the armed forces have effectively contained the territorial ambitions of the Boko Haram terrorists by substantially degrading their capacity to attack and wreak havoc, they remain intent on shedding blood and sowing fear. There is also the threat of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) in the Lake Chad Islands and part of Southern Borno.
&ldquo;Also, more often these days, these insurgents are focusing on soft targets, opportunistic attacks on isolated military units, as well as an increasingly sophisticated propaganda aimed at making them out to be more organised and lethal than they really are.
&ldquo;This ever-increasing reliance on propaganda is a reminder that this is not only a &lsquo;battleground&rsquo; war; it is just as much an information-and-narrative war. Winning hearts and minds has always been important in military warfare; it is even more so in a century defined by information and communication technologies.
&ldquo;As 21st-century military officers, how you project your strength and confidence to your enemies and the world, especially using social and digital media tools, is as important as the sophistication of the conventional arms and ammunition that you wield.
&ldquo;But to do so effectively also means that you must take the time and trouble to fully understand the nature of the threats that confront us, the narratives and philosophies that underlie those threats,&rdquo; the vice president stated.
Osinbajo told the officers that President Muhammadu Buhari, in collaboration with governors, has been reviewing the security architecture of the country, which involved not just the armed forces but also the police, who have recently announced their community policing strategy.
He said: &ldquo;This initiative involves the recruitment and training of policemen in each local government and ensuring that such new policemen remain in their local governments working with local and traditional authorities to maintain peace and security.
&ldquo;As the President has said, security is a 24-hour occupation involving continuous investments in strategy and innovation. We will continue to take all necessary measures to tackle all forms of criminality across the country and to safeguard lives and property of all Nigerians.
&ldquo;The Nigerian Air Force will, as part of the Armed Forces, continued to be at the forefront of our national security interventions. I note in particular the extremely successful digitally accurate bombings of terrorist hideouts in April that led to the destruction of Boko Haram mechanic workshop in Borno&ldquo;In May, there were airstrikes on Tumbun Hamma on the fringes of Lake Chad, inflicting heavy casualties on ISWAP forces under Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole; while in June, airstrikes on Sambisa Forest further eliminated insurgents&ldquo;It is particularly commendable that you are adopting measures to ensure that the resources available to you are used judiciously; in a manner that delivers optimal results and maximum value for money.
&ldquo;This nation is great and can only become greater. We are Africa&rsquo;s largest economy by GDP &ndash; states of Nigeria have larger economies than many African states. We have become the last frontier for major economic growth.
&ldquo;We are the world&rsquo;s largest growers of cassava and yams, we are top five in the world in sorghum, millet; we are approaching self-sufficiency in paddy rice production. Our potential in technology and entertainment has been attracting huge attention.
&ldquo;First is the market, at 174 million GSM phones, we are top 10 telephone users in the world, and we have the highest percentage of people who use internet on their phones in the world. We are also number two in mobile internet banking in the world; 17 million Nigerians are on Facebook.
&ldquo;Microsoft has announced that it will establish a 100 million dollar African Develop Centre in Nigeria. We are already building our own drones. But not only are we building drones, we are also making spare parts for our aircraft. We are also manufacturing armoured personnel carriers and all sorts of different military platforms.
&ldquo;All of these are things that Nigerians are doing in this country. Just last week, we saw, at the Army Day, sophisticated mine sweepers that are manufactured in this country. In a few short years, this country will be, by far, the greatest military force in Africa and certainly the most developed economy in Africa.
&ldquo;All of these have been built on the sacrifices of many in blood and sweat, especially men and women of the armed forces. What will undermine our efforts now and in the future is disunity. All of those who are preaching narratives of divisions along ethnic and religious lines. We must resist all who try to destroy our present gains and in particular our future.
&ldquo;The future of our country is bright; all we need to do is to keep focus not to allow any to preach any division amongst us. If we remain stable and united, everything that we desire for our great country will be ours.&rdquo;"
589,"President Muhammadu Buhari has said that Nigeria needs prayers now more than it has ever needed it.
He told this to pilgrim officials to this year&rsquo;s hajj while cautioning them against lack of discipline and high-handedness on pilgrims.
He spoke during the flag-off of the inaugural flight for the 2019 hajj in Katsina, adding that his government had already instructed the National Hajj Commission (NAHCON) and other related agencies to prioritise pilgrims&rsquo; welfare.
The inaugural flight lifted about 526 pilgrims from Dutsinma, Kurfi and Mani local government areas of Katsina State.
Insecurity, poverty, unemployment and others have remained a great concern to the Nigerian Government and its citizens across the country.
And President Buhari, apparently believing prayers can avail much in the country&rsquo;s situation, told the pilgrims, &ldquo;Nigeria needs your prayers now more than ever before. Make the best out of the hajj experience and improve on your relationship with your creator and discharge your duties to your country as responsible citizens.&rdquo;
He was represented by the governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari.
Speaking at the event, the Saudi Counselor in Nigeria, Yusuf Al-Ghamdi, also urged the pilgrims to make sure they obey laws and regulations of hajj exercise."
590,"Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, on Saturday said the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is creating the largest wave of poverty in human history.
Atiku, who also insisted that the greatest threat to the security of the country in 2019 is not the Boko Haram/ISWAP insurgency but the growing wave of poverty, stated this in his reaction to the recent report by the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, indicating that over 98 million Nigerians were living in multi-dimensional poverty.
According to the former VP who was the presidential candidate if the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last general elections, the report indicated that poverty had become the fastest growing venture in Nigeria over the last four years.
In a statement issued by his media adviser, Paul Ibe, Atiku insisted that there was an urgent and compelling need for institutions of the Nigerian state to understand that it was an appalling dereliction of duty to stand idly by and allow misery multiply in the populace.
According to him, this was no longer a grassroots problem.
He said: &ldquo;The failure of our economy over the last four years affects everyone from top to bottom. Four years ago, Aliko Dangote, Nigeria&rsquo;s richest man, was worth $25bn. However, his net worth in 2019 is less than half that. He joined thousands of industrialists whose wealth and their ability to produce, had eroded in recent years, and continue to do so.
&ldquo;With the National Bureau of Statistics reporting a net job loss of over six million since 2015, we see that if industrialists have their wealth eroding, it affects their ability to create opportunities, which means that the trickle-down effect gradually dries.&rdquo;
Atiku further warned that the world was noticing, hence Foreign Direct Investment was shifting from Nigeria to Ghana, making Ghana the top recipient of FDI in West Africa in the last year.
He said: &ldquo;And in the wake of this report by the UNDP, we are greeted with nonchalance by those who led us into this crisis. It is as though they think that as long as they and their families are not amongst those 98 million extremely poor Nigerians, things can carry on as before.
&ldquo;But that cannot be allowed to be the case. Those who have the ability, including the Council of State, all former leaders, elder-statesmen, and especially the other arms of government, must begin to collaborate for solutions, before the number increases from 98 million, to all 198 million Nigerians.
&ldquo;We must remember that we are stakeholders in the Nigerian project; stakeholders who must speak up for those 98 million people who are losing their voices to poverty.&rdquo;"
591,"Alva Johnson, a former campaign aide for US President Donald Trump has said a video which has been circulating on social media proves her claim that he &ldquo;violated her without consent&rsquo;.
Trump was filmed kissing campaign aide Alava in the video captured in 2016 backing her claim after she first came forward in February this year to announce she was suing the president over the alleged incident.
She said at the time that Mr Trump was with her at a rally in Florida in August 2016 when he went in to kiss her without warning. She said she managed to turn her head in time so his lips only hit the side of her mouth.
&ldquo;I immediately felt violated because I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it or wanting it,&rdquo; she said.
Mr Trump&rsquo;s office immediately denied the event had ever occurred and White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders described the allegations as &ldquo;absurd&rdquo; and &ldquo;directly contradicted by multiple highly credible eyewitness accounts&rdquo;.
However, in a bid to douse the effect of the recent video, lawyers for Mr Trump have released a short 15-second counter video which they claim shows Ms Johnson&rsquo;s accusations are baseless.
In the short clip Mr Trump can be seen amid dozens of campaign staff leaning in and kissing the side of Ms Johnson&rsquo;s face while he also shakes her hand in a friendly manner"
592,"Donald Trump abandoned the Iran nuclear deal to spite Barack Obama, according to a leaked memo written by the UK&rsquo;s former ambassador to the US.
Sir Kim Darroch described the move on Sunday as an act of diplomatic vandalism.
The report comes following news last week that Darroch sent diplomatic cables describing President Donald Trump as inept, insecure and incompetent, a UK government official confirmed to the media. Darroch has since resigned.
Reports revealed the memo was written after the then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson appealed to the US in 2018 to stick with the nuclear deal.
Under that agreement Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities.
It would also allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.
However, President Trump did not think that the deal went far enough.
Media reports showed that after Mr Johnson returned to the UK from the US, Sir Kim wrote that President Trump appeared to be abandoning the nuclear deal for personality reasons because the pact had been agreed by his predecessor, Barack Obama.
A UK Foreign Office spokesman told the mediaon Saturday that whoever leaked the cables should face the consequences of their actions."
593,"Nobel Laureate, Wole Soyinka, has said Nigeria&rsquo;s problems are beyond the capacity of President Muhammadu Buhari&rsquo;s administration.
Soyinka made this comment while hosting students who paid him a visit on his 85th birthday.
He called for a national summit to address some of the socioeconomic and political challenges facing the country.
Also, he called on the federal government to shun partisanship and focus on delivering good governance to the Nigerian populace.
&ldquo;The problems of this nation are beyond the solution that can be offered by this government, that&rsquo;s the first admission; they have to stop thinking in partisan government,&rdquo; Soyinka said.
&ldquo;There has always been a major problem with successive governments. It&rsquo;s easier on the state level to say that a particular state is definitely doing better than another state. But the central government has failed, that&rsquo;s my view in the main.
&ldquo;There is a minimal level which any government which has been elected to power must achieve to be considered a true representative of the people.
&ldquo;Look at what&rsquo;s happening today with the cattle all over the place, that&rsquo;s a security issue which should never have reached this level. That singular act has resulted in hundreds of people being killed, farms were taken over; it has wiped away a lot of the positive achievements of the government.
&ldquo;They need to confront this nation as a habitation of human beings where very serious issues like economy, security, health, even threats of secession come up every day and convoke at the same time, a national conference, what I call an Indaba across all section which we will all meet and debate everything, including the economy of this nation.&rdquo;"
594,"Modern medical treatment of high blood pressure is very highly unscientific as it brings down the pressure by drugs without making any effort to remove the underlying causes. Drugs may temporarily reduce blood pressure, but they do not cure the condition and are harmful in the ultimate analysis. All drugs against hypertension without exception are toxic and have distressing side effects. The safest way to cure hypertension is to remove the real cause. And the natural way of dealing with it is to eliminate the poison from the system which causes it.
A person suffering from high blood pressure should always follow a well-balanced routine of proper diet, exercise and rest. Diet is of primary importance. Meat and eggs cause blood pressure to rise more than any other food. The pressure is lowered and blood clotting diminished by partaking of higher fruit content, lower protein, and non-flesh diet is helpful in getting rid of the poison from the body. Hypertension patient should start the process of healing by living on an exclusive fruit diet for at least a week, and take fruits at five-hourly intervals thrice in the day. Oranges, apples, pears, mangoes, guava, pineapples, raspberry, watermelon are the best diet for such cases. Bananas and Jack fruit should not be taken. Milk may be taken after a week of 'fruits only' diet. The milk should be fresh and should be boiled only once. The patient can also take cereals in his food after the two weeks.
Vegetables are also good for the patient of hypertension. They should be preferably taken raw. But if they are cooked, it should be ensured that their natural juices are not burnt in the process of cooking. Vegetables like cucumber, carrot, tomatoes, onion, radish, cabbage and spinach are best taken in their raw form. They may be cut into small pieces and sprinkled with a little salt and the juice of a lemon added to them as to make them more palatable.
Garlic is regarded as one of the most effective remedies to lower blood pressure. The pressure and tension are reduced because it has the power to ease the spasms of the small arteries. Garlic also shows the pulse and modifies the heart rhythm besides relieving the symptoms of dizziness, numbness, and shortness of breath and the formation of gas within the digestive tract. The average dosage should be two to three capsules a day to make a dent in the blood pressure.
Indian gooseberry (Amla) is another effective remedy for high blood pressure. A tablespoonful each of fresh amla juice honey mixed together should be taken every morning for the hypertensive patient.
Lemon is also regarded as a valuable food to control high blood pressure. It is a rich source of vitamin P which is found in both the juice and the peel of the fruit. This vitamin is essential for preventing capillary fragility.
Watermelon is another valuable safeguard against high blood pressure. It was proved by experiments that a substance extracted from watermelon seeds has a definite action in dilating the blood vessels, which results in lowering the blood pressure.
Studies have also revealed an important link between dietary calcium and potassium and hypertension. Researchers have found that people who take potassium-rich diets have a low incidence of hypertension even if they do not control their salt intake. They have also found that people with hypertension do not seem to get much calcium in the form of dairy products. The two essential nutrients seem to help the body throw off excess sodium and are involved in important functions which control the working of the vascular system. Potassium is found in abundance in fruits and vegetables, while calcium is found in dairy products.
Exercise also plays an important role in curing hypertension. Walking is an excellent form of exercise. It helps to relieve tension, builds up the muscles and aids in the circulation of blood. As the blood pressure shows sign of abating, more exercise like bicycling, swimming, Jogging should be taken.
Water treatment for high blood pressure: Prolonged neutral bath daily for an hour or so at 90 to 95 degrees will be beneficial. A cold compress should be kept on the head during the bath. Other water treatments include hot foot or leg bath for 10 minutes, hot compress over the heart replacing it as bath cools down.
A person suffering from hypertension must ensure at least eight hours of restful sleep because proper rest is an important aspect of the treatment.
The most important of all is that the patient must avoid over-straining, worries, tension, anger and haste. He/she must try to be cheerful and develop a contented mind. Though the natural treatment may take some time it is the safest and best way to get rid of the disease."
595,"Rheumatism is recognized as one of the most serious threats to health. It is a crippling disease which causes widespread invalidism, but it rarely kills. The disease is refers to an acute or chronic illness which is characterized by pain and swelling of the muscles, ligaments and tendons or the joints. It affects both men and women, young and old. The disease, quite often extends to the heart and valves and the lining of the vital order becomes inflamed. It is the most common cause in 80 percent of the cases of valvular organic diseases of the heart.
The Treatment:
In acute rheumatism, the patient should be put on a short fast of orange juice and water for 3 0r 4 days. While during the fasting, the bowels should be cleansed through a warm water enema. Then after the juice fast, the patient should be placed on a restricted diet for 14 days. In this phase, orange or grape fruit may be taken for breakfast, lunch may be of a raw salad of any vegetables in season, with raisins, prunes, figs or dates; and for dinner, one or two steamed vegetables such as spinach, cabbage, carrots, turnips, cauliflower, etc., and a few nuts or some sweet fruit may be taken. No bread or potatoes or other starchy food should be taken; otherwise the effect will be lost. After that, the patient may gradually commence a well-balanced diet of three basic food groups, namely:

Seeds, nuts and grains.
Vegetables
And fruits.

In chronic rheumatism, the patient may be placed on an all-fruit diet for four or five days. In this phase, the patient should have three meals a day of fresh, juicy fruits such as apples, grapes, peaches, pears, oranges, pineapples, and grapefruit. He may thereafter gradually adopt a well-balanced diet.
The patient should take ripe fruits and fresh vegetables in abundance. Lots of buttermilk should be taken. The foods which should be avoided are: meat, fish, white bread, sugar, refined cereals, rich indigestible and highly seasoned foods, tea, coffee, alcohol, sauces, pickles, and condiments.
Raw potato juice is regarded as an excellent food remedy for rheumatism. One or two teaspoonful of the juice pressed out of mashed raw potato should be taken before meals. This will help eliminate an acid condition and relieve rheumatism. The skin of the potato is also an excellent food remedy for rheumatism. The skin is exceptionally rich in vital mineral salts and the water in which the peelings have been boiled is one of the best medicines for the ailments caused by excess of acid in the system. The potato peelings should be thoroughly washed and boiled for a few minutes. The decoction should then be strained and a glassful of the same should be taken three or four times daily.
Celery is another effective food remedy for rheumatism. A fluid extract of the seeds is more powerful than the raw vegetable. This also has a tonic action on the stomach and kidneys. Five to ten drops of this fluid should be taken in hot water before meals. The powdered seeds of the fruit can be used as a condiment. Lemons are also valuable and the juice of two or three lemons may be taken each day.
Other helpful methods in the treatment of rheumatism are the application of radiant heat and hot packs to the affected parts, a hot tub bath, cabinet steam bath, dry fiction and a sponge bath.
Hot Epsom-salt baths are also known to be beneficial and should be taken twice a week for three months in case of chronic rheumatism and once weekly after the three months. The affected parts should be bathed twice daily in hot water containing Epsom-salt after which some olive oil should be applied.
Fresh air, deep breathing and light outdoor exercises are also beneficial. But dampness and cold should be avoided."
596,"Humans view the subject of eating from the wrong angle. We should eat to live but many of us eat to die. We advocate temperance and even abstinence in the use of those things which do not appeal to our own senses, but most of us are far from being temperate in our overeating. We have a very keen vision when searching for weaknesses and faults in others, but we are quite near-sighted in regarding our own.
The chronic drinker degenerate and so does the glutton. They both deteriorate. Gluttony is more common than drunkard and it is responsible for more ills. Overeating often causes so much irritation that food does not satisfy the cravings (an intense desire for some particular thing), and then drug is used. Improper eating, which is majorly, has been the causes of most of the ailment in humans. If we humans would learn to be moderate in all things, disease and early death would be very rare.
It is quite important to combine foods properly, but the worst combinations of food eaten in moderation are harmless, as compared to the damage done by overeating of the best foods. Overeating is with us from the cradle to the grave. It shortens our days and fills them with suffering.
A belief that a pregnant woman must eat for two, and thus, the mothers have generally obeyed. The result is that women suffer greatly during pregnancy and at childbirth. The morning sickness, the aching back, the headache, the swollen legs and all of the discomforts and diseases from which civilized women suffers during this period are mostly due to improper eating. Pregnancy and childbirth are physiologic and are completely lacking of any great amount of discomfort, pain or danger when women lead normal lives. The overeating affects both mother and child. And sometimes labor is so prolonged that the child dies and at other times the baby is so large that it cannot be born naturally. The mother&rsquo;s suffering is frequently very great. Babies born of normal mothers, who have lived moderately on a non-stimulating diet during gestation, are small. They rarely weigh more than six pounds. Their bones are flexible. The skull can easily be molded because the bones are very gristly (difficult to chew), and the result is that childbirth is rapid and practically lack any amount of discomfort. But however, there are very few normal mothers, and also normal babies are rare.
A heavy baby is never healthy. Its growth has been forced by excessive maternal feeding. Such baby&rsquo;s show early sign of catarrhal afflictions, indigestion or skin disease, their bodies are filled with poisons before they are born. Mothers who overeat invariably over feed their babies. The family, friends and physicians give advice that she must eat much to be able to feed the child, and the child must be fed frequently in order to grow. This sounds very plausible, but it doesn&rsquo;t work well in practice. The questions to be asked are; why do babies soon show catarrhal symptoms? Why do they vomit so much? Why are they so subject to stomach and intestinal disorders? Why do they have skin eruptions? And the answer is because they are over fed.
The diseases of babies are of most entirely of digestive origin, and in nearly every instances, over feeding is the cause. One&rsquo;s intentions may be good, but good intentions coupled with wrong actions are deadly to infants. Parental love too often takes the form of indulging them and so it happens that hundreds of thousands of little ones are placed in their coffins annually through love. Why do little children suffer so much from eruptive diseases, whooping cough, tonsillitis, adenoids, diphtheria and numerous other diseases? This is simply because they are over fed. The younger the child the greater is the percent of disease due to wrong feeding. In adult life, overeating and eating improperly otherwise are still the principal causes of disease. And during adult life the causation of disease is more complex than in childhood, for the senses have been more fully developed and instead of confining our physical sins to overeating we fall prey to the abuse of various appetites and passions. Vigorous adults are often the victims of pneumonia, typhoid fever and tuberculosis. Overeating is mainly to blame, and not the bacteria which are given as the principal cause. Rheumatism, kidney disease and diseases that manifest in hardening of the various tissues, all being forms of degeneration, are quite common. And they also, the principal cause is overeating.
There are a great number of people who live many years without any special disease, but who are always on the brink of being ill. They are full-blooded and too over-weight. Although they are often considered successful, they are never fully efficient either physically or mentally. They do not know what good health is, but they are so accustomed to their state of toleration that they consider themselves healthy. They are rather proud of their over-weight and their friends mistake their precarious condition for health. These kinds of people often die suddenly, and friends and conversancy are very much surprised. No healthy man dies suddenly and unexpectedly except by accident.
Instead of growing old gracefully, in possession of our senses and faculties, we die prematurely or go into physical and mental decay. Blurry eyes, pettiness, childishness and loss of mental faculties are no part of nature&rsquo;s plan for advanced years. Those manifestations result from man&rsquo;s improvement on nature. From birth to death we are victims of this terrible demon of overeating. It deprives us of friends and relatives. It takes away our strength and health. It makes us mentally inefficient and cowardly. And at last it deprives us of life when our work is not half done and our days should not be half run. Although overeating is not only the cause, but it is the overwhelming one. It is the basic cause. Aided by other bad habits and it conquer us. We are what we are because of our parentage, plus what we eat, drink, breathe and think, and the eating largely influences the other factors of life.
Cholera infantum &ndash; This disease causes the death of many babies, but it never occurs in babies who are fed moderately on natural, clean food, not to exceed three or four times a day. When the child is perversely irritable and the mother thinks that it is irritable because it&rsquo;s hungry and feeds it accordingly. But the real cause of the irritability is the over feeding that has already taken place. The baby has had so much milk that it is unable to digest all of it. A part of the milk spoils in the digestive tract. And the fermented material is partly absorbed and irritates the whole system. A part of it remains in the alimentary tract where it acts as a direct local irritant to the intestines. When these are irritated, the blood-vessels begin to pour out their serum to soothe the bowels and the result is diarrhea. The sick child is feed often, and the digestive power is practically absent. The additional food given ferments and more serum has to be thrown out to protect the intestinal walls. And soon there is a well-established case of cholera infantum. If only enough food had been given to satisfy the bodily requirements, none of the milk would have spoiled in the alimentary tract. If all feeding had been stopped as soon as the child became irritable and pinched looking about the mouth and nose, and all the water desired has been given and the child kept warm there would have been no serious disease. Therefore, the less food given the quicker the recoveries and the fewer the fatalities will be.
Adenoid - Another disease which is common in childhood is adenoids. These diseases are merely the symptoms of perverted nutrition. The disease is due to indigestion. The indigestion is due to overeating. When a child eats more than can be digested, generally bolting the food, which is often of a sentimental character. The excessive amount of food cannot be digested, and as the intestines and the stomach are moist and have a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, fermentation soon takes place. Some of the results of fermentation in the alimentary tract are acids, gases and bacterial poisons. These deleterious substances are absorbed into the blood stream and go to all parts of the body, acting as irritants. A coated tongue, or an irritated tongue, both due to indigestion, is a co-occurrence of adenoids. Such diseases do not merely happen. There are good reasons for their appearance. They are not reflections on the child, but they are on the parents who should have the right knowledge and should take time and pains enough to educate and train the child into health.
Tuberculosis - This is another result of ruined nutrition. This is also from overeating, which then causes indigestion. The irritating products of food fermenting in the alimentary tract are taken up by the blood. The blood goes to the lungs where it irritates the delicate mucous membrane. In self-protection it begins to secrete an excess of mucus and if the irritation is great enough, pus. The various bacteria are incidental. The tubercular bacillus is never able to gain a foot hold in healthy lungs, but after degeneration of lung tissue has taken place, the lungs then furnish a splendid home for this bacillus. The tubercular bacillus is a scavenger and therefore does not thrive in healthy bodies. It is the result of disease, not the cause.
Tubercular patients never have healthy digestive organs. Unluckily, nearly all of them are persuaded to eat many times more food than they can digest, and thus they have no opportunity to recover, for the over feeding ruins the digestive and assimilative powers beyond restorative ability. A larger percent of the human perish miserably from this disease, which is principally the result from the ingestion of too much food. The free use of devitalized foods such as sterilized milk, refined sugar and finely bolted wheat flour is doubtless a great factor in so reducing bodily resistance that the system fall a prey to. Too little breathing and poor devitalized air is also important factors.
Rheumatism &ndash; This is also another result of overeating. Although there are many other causes, but overeating is the chiefly cause. Rheumatism is due to internal dirt. A filthy alimentary tract makes filthy blood. It is commonly said that the poison in rheumatism is uric acid, and of course, it is, but there are no uric acid deposits in the body of a sensible eater. The elimination in the disease is not perfect. The skin, the kidneys, the bowels, and the lungs do not throw out the debris (dirt) as they should, and perhaps only one or two of these organs are acting inadequately. The debris is stored up in the system. The reason why the organs of elimination fail to act is because so much work is thrust upon them that they grow weary (wear out), and also a part of the material which equipped them is the product of decay in the alimentary tract, and they cannot thrive on poor material. When the eliminative organs fail to perform their function, their waste is deposited in those parts of the body which are weakened. The irritation from this foreign substance causes inflammation and the result is pain. The extent to which this depositing of material will go is well exemplified in some cases of multiple articular rheumatism, or arthritis distortion, where the deposits are so great that many of the joints become fixed.
Though some various types of food do not combine well, but still if they are eaten in moderation, they will do but little harm. But when we overeat, the evil results are bound to manifest, no matter how good the food may be, although it takes some time or years before they are detectable. The effects are cumulative. Each day there is a little fermentation with absorption of the poisonous products. Each day the body degenerates a little. Then the time will come when the body can no longer continue its work, and the individual must choose either to reform and suffer or death.
The overeating habit is so common and comes on so perniciously that the diseased person does not realize that they are eating to excess. The consequent discomforts are blamed on the other things. Babies are fed every two hours or oftener. They should be fed at least three or four times a day, and never at night. When they are able to eat solid foods they should get three meals a day and generally two or more lunches. Some children seem to be lunching at all times. They have fruit or bread and butter with jelly or jam in the hand almost all the time. They are encouraged to eat much and often to produce growth and strength. This kind of feeding often does produce large children, heavy in weight, but they are not healthy. The excess causes disease and death. Such frequent feeding allows no rest for the digestive organs. The overwork imposed upon them and the fermentation cause irritation. This irritation manifests in a constant and almost irresistible desire for food.
Those who eat to excess often eat more than three times a day. If a person is in fair health and wishes to evolve into self-mastery and good health, he should make up his mind never to eat more than three times a day. And nothing but plain water should enter his mouth except meal times.

597,"Attachments; Not of the digital nature, but physical and that of emotions. Man has to love something or someone, grow a hobby, develop a skill, or learn a trade.
For me, it is the rush; to feel the air flow through the face at 90mph, to caress her handles, hug her tank. To have her trust in me that I will lead accordingly as she reciprocates same elegantly taking turns, with each twist of the throttle and each pull or push of her levers till we reach a climax; between the man and the machine."
598,"It has been 19 years since the first camera phone; The J-SH04made by Sharp Corporation and released by J-Phone(Now SoftBankMobile). The phone, available only in Japan then was with 110,000-pixelCMOS and256-color display. Basically, it took man 184 years to attempt to perfect the success of Nic&eacute;phore Ni&eacute;pce and integrate it to a phone.
By contrast the evolution of Cameras was quick and easily integrated to mans&rsquo; social life; the developments of the Daguerreotypes and the Calotype birthing into the use of dry plates and the George Eastman produced Kodak in 1888 offered man a whole lot of alternatives in capturing moments that matter to him.
The quantum leap occurred in 1928 when Paul Franke and Reinhold Heidecke made the Rolleiflex in two variations, one a twin lens reflex camera and the other a single lens reflex camera. These were however too bulky to achieve popularity but the concept and the design were quickly accepted and further improved.
HOW DOES DSLR CAMERAS COMPARE TO A SMART PHONE CAMERA
There are lots of similarities with images from either a Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) or a smart phone camera, while the later would still churn out a very neat image depending on the sophistication of the phone and skill of the user. The former offers a wider range of features to play with ranging from shutter speed to aperture. This range of options allows the image to appear more real as it captures every detail on the subject.
Picture Quality:
There are a huge amount of variables here, but here is a fairly simplistic comparison between an image shot on an iPhone 6s, and a photograph taken with a Nikon D3300.

The resolution on the unedited photo taken with the DSLR was 5184 x 3456 (of course, there are other options available) while the iPhone output an image at 3264 x 2448. The DSLR captured more of the range of color on the cup, while the smartphone image is more washed out.
Again, it&rsquo;s worth noting that different smartphones have different capabilities. Since these two devices were both entry-level as of a couple of years ago, they provide a fair comparison.
Storage:
All sorts of files vie for spacel over your smartphone&rsquo;s storage: apps, podcasts, music, and so on. Unless you opted for a high-capacity model, you&rsquo;re going to run out of space quickly. Even with a high capacity smartphone it still can&rsquo;t be compared to the flexibility of a DSLR. Furthermore, your DSLR is going to specialize in photo and video alone. Since most use SD cards, shooting at high resolution, especially when it comes to video, takes up a fair amount of space. That said, it&rsquo;s easy to equip yourself with enough SD cards to cater to your needs.
Control On Depth of Field:
Most smartphone camera apps are broadly similar to the auto function on a DSLR: awesome in most normal situations, at the cost of some close control. However, after spending time to know your DSLR, you&rsquo;ll be able to produce any kind of photograph you want. Though there&rsquo;s also simpler stuff that you can do with a decent camera that&rsquo;s much more difficult to achieve on your phone.
DSLRs offer a lot of control over focus, which lends itself to some cool techniques. It&rsquo;s easy to manipulatedepth of field, for example:
Using a DLSR makes it easy to isolate a particular part of the scene. By zooming in and focusing on something close to me, I made the background blurry to direct the viewer&rsquo;s attention to my subject. Using a standard smartphone focus just doesn&rsquo;t offer the same capacity: the background blurred a little, but it&rsquo;s nowhere near as effective.
The only limits on your freedom to compose your shots and capture different tones and colors with a DSLR are your imagination and your surroundings. When you start introducing specialized lenses into the mix, it&rsquo;s a real blank canvas.
The Future Is In Smartphones Or is it?
Few days ago, Bloomburgs Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning to release an iPhone that has three rear cameras in 2019; with android phone makers including LG and Huawei having already released triple-camera systems that allow for more creative flexibility and ultra-wide-angle shots this announcement wasn&rsquo;t so surprising.
Gurman reported that Apple is set to join them with the successor to the XS Max, with the newest camera capturing a wider field of view. The third rear camera will also &ldquo;capture more pixels so Apple software could, for example, automatically repair a video or photo to fit in a subject that may have been accidentally cut off from the initial shot.
These are new features that could possibly shift the future of imaging to smartphones while DSLRs are phased out given the more handy and easy to pocket nature of smartphones. Rest assured as smartphone makers are looking to improve on the cameras, the likes of Canon and Nikon would look to keep improving on the quality of their cameras as well."
599,"Occasionally,we all have feelings of anxiety in our daily lives;maybe when taking a test,making major decision, when starting a business or when public speaking .However,what happens when the anxiety attacks persist for a long time?
After reading an article on anxiety disorders,I realised that I related to almost every symptom and the information given.I had had anxiety attacks for several months but had not known what was happening.All the sudden panic attacks,feelings of overwhelming worry and fear had affected my physical health,relationships and work.I had trouble sleeping and had nigtmares of memories that kept replaying in my mind.Many are the times I felt tired and restless.I felt disconnected from my body and had no control of my own thoughts.I had poor eating habits and lost weight which was just attributed to moving to a new school.
Most people have no idea about anxiety disorder and some of those who do,do not think it is a mojor issue to be dealt with.It may be hard to talk to people who have never known serious anxiety.I remember sharing my struggles with my best friend and he just brushed over it saying he does not know how to help.People that suffer from anxiety tend to be quiet about it out of fear of being hurt more when they speak out.When you talk to those around you about your feelings and it yields no response,you assume that no one will understand and bother about it.Therefore,many people deal with anxiety by avoiding situations that trigger the feelings.
However,it is important to note that anxiety is treatable.Seeking help from therapists and psychologists is important.It helps you change your thinking to feel and act better.It determines thoughts and behaviour patterns responsible for anxiety and methods to deal with them.The psychotherapists may also expose you to a safe environment that causes anxiety and by repeating things that trigger the feelings,they lose their power.Medication such as antidepressants and sedatives balance brain chemistry.
Visiting the psychotherapists once is not a guarantee that anxiety is dealt with.It is a process to eventually overcome anxiety.Get enough sleep,meditate,be active by exercising,have a healthy diet and avoid alcohol and caffeine.
It is important to talk about mental health.It is a cause of overall disease burdens.Don't sweep symptoms bunder the rug.Reach out to someone who can help,it is worth it.

600,"I have finally figured out why men are the way they are. It was just one of those unplanned things,like a Kenyan lady noticing the effects of Shea Butter on her skin and men getting aware of their women&rsquo;s choice of Sanitary Pads. Only more useful.
We live in the information age,yeah?We are what we know,and media make the man. So where are men getting the information that is making them think,talk,act and look like they do?
These people aren&rsquo;t born with the attitude they have and neither do they get them from Newspapers,because the men who read newspapers read the same ones read by women. The same goes for TV and movies -they&rsquo;re not gender specific,and if the garbled messages were coming from them, women would act the same way men do. Which of course, they don&rsquo;t.

Only one mass medium is divided into men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s section:Magazines. When my train of thought pulled into that section,I jumped off,ran to the nearest newsstands and purchased copies of MALE,TRUE MEN and MEN&rsquo;S HEALTH with intentions of getting something useful. Talk about your simplistic revelations. I must confess that I was heartbroken to find out that men&rsquo;s magazines only had highlights such as: Hit her hot spots,Seeking thrills,Chase money,she&rsquo;ll chase you and not From boyhood to manhood, Better man for yourself. Men,am I dreaming?None of the magazines had what I was looking for. No wonder men are the way they are.

Seems women are the only ones double-dealing here; caring for themselves and at the same time try to understand men. Well, I don&rsquo;t know why men are the way they are;It only takes one to know the other, you know?So,only a man can explain that. But I have heard from fellow women the categories of men that are there. Ladies have dropped the idea that &ldquo;All men are the same&rdquo; and emphasized on,each man has a category they fit in. Here It Is!


1.Bible Men
These type of men are dependent on the Bible. What they do and what they talk about comes from the Holy Book. These are the kind that respect women but never believe in women leading &ndash; defending themselves that no woman in the bible lead anything. This is the same category that will always be cautious with ladies ,this is after either having self experienced it or learning from Samson&rsquo;s and Adam&rsquo;s stories. Bible men are always nicely dressed though from Monday to Monday its always official and always expect their women to dress the same. They are not gentlemen, they are moral-oriented!


Subaru Boys

These men are referred to as boys because of how they carry themselves. Mostly,these guys travel in a pack,usually in their twenties and early thirties and hang out together due to mutual interests which often is The Blue Subarus. These men are oriented towards The Single lifestyle,love for adventure and speech &ldquo;you guy!My guy! Si you pigia Caro we pitia her on our way to Naivasha&rdquo;. They often value their bond with each other and always have one simple rule, &ldquo;Boys before hoes&rdquo;. Rarely will you find a guy in this group reasoning for himself. They like women, a lot. They normally dress up to impress. Do you guys know Andrew Kibe? Unlike Bible Men, these ones are gentlemen but only for the first 100 days of knowing a woman.


&ldquo;Just there&rdquo;/Normal men

These men are just there; just the way they are. They wont critic a woman neither will they congratulate her. They are bothered less by what other people do around them. Incase they are In a relationship, they&rsquo;ll wait for you to call, you to suggest a hangout joint,they will respond according to how you react. They are gentlemen but only after you show it out to them that you need that treat. These men are solitary;they are afraid of being shamed,hurt or being in the limelight. They will spend the little they have and live to work the following day.


Mama&rsquo;s Boys/Puppy Boys

These ones here are as a result of always being under someone&rsquo;s watch(mostly their mothers/sisters)hence the adoption to it. They are too playful and everything is always about them. They have unexplained mood swings and attitudes and can&rsquo;t do anything without consultation from mother figure. They do not know what to do;they do not know how to act in front a lady. They prefer instructions but again you can&rsquo;t order them around just like that..You know how sometimes puppies just refuse to eat?

To tell the truth: &ldquo;its not too often in this day and age that one finds a man with his head on straight and his priorities in order.&rdquo;
We knew that. Now we know why."
601,"In 2016 it was alleged that the announcement of Pep Guardiollas arrival at Etihad months to the end of that season distabilised Manuel Pelegrini's performance in the remaining matches.

Pellegrinis target was to win a quadruple that season, however after the news of his replacement the club only managed to pick 7 points from the next 7 matches. They ended up winning the league cup but lost in the semifinal match of the champions league to Real Madrid. they also ended up fighting for a draw at swansea so as to secure the fourth place.

Guardiola who was at Munich at the time has since come out to apologize to the Westham boss. he however said that he was unaware of the effect that the move had in the city's locker room.
Guardiola has further lauded his predecessors at city for creating an incredible team through the signings they did.
One of the most important signings that Pelegrini made at city was that of Raheem Sterling who was very instrumental in last weekends final of the Carabao cup against Chelsea at Wembley. pep lauded sterling for taking rsponsibility by accepting to take the final penalty kick which was the decider. city face Westham on Wednesday in what is Pellegrinis first encounter with city since his departure in 2016."
602,"You feel stressed when there's an emotional or physical strain on your well-being. It's the result of thoughts that frustrates you.
Not all stress are bad, some spur you to solve the problem causing you to be stressed. While some in most cases if not addressed could kill you. Stress causes several diseases such as mental health problems, depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.
It is then pertinent for it to be addressed before it takes its toll on you, these few points will help you to manage stress.

Regular Exercise: It has been proved overtime that exercises helps our body to function properly. Mild exercises like Yoga, cycling, Evening walks and so on can help relax your mind and release the stress off your body.
Stay Positive:Look on the positive side, life isn't easy, most people can relate with that. Focus on the wonderful things working in your life and be positive that life will always be better.
Eat the right food: Check if you are eating right, try adding vegetables and fruits to your daily food intake. Some fruits and veggies like carrots, nuts, banana and avocado help relieve stress.
Drink enough water: Make sure you drink enough water daily. Don't wait for your body to be worn out before you drink water. Water helps in proper functioning of the body and that includes dealing with stress.
Relax: There are several ways to relax but the most important is sleep. Your mind and entire body relaxes when you sleep. Get plenty of rest and see the results.

Finally, it takes YOU to let go of the stress, be grateful for life itself and stay optimistic always."

605,"  So today I had this conversation with a female friend who thinks Brie Larson doesn't fit the role of Captain Marvel, her point being that Brie Larson's too in her words ""gentle looking"". 😅

  Honestly at first I must say it was hard for me accepting Brie, because I had already disregarded her as not being the superhero type, especially because she has such a sweet look 🤭, but down the line I've come to accept her as my Captain Marvel

  Reflecting on it all, I think why the choice of Brie was such a hard one for me to stomach was because of the identity that had been given to female superheroes in mainstream cinema (whether live-action/animation).

  Female superheroes never came to me as the idea of being simple looking &amp; ordinary ladies/women that you could meet on the street or that could live next door. Everytime I pictured a female superheroes, I saw that extremely sexy and badasss looking lady with the words ""I kick butt and take names"" written all across her face.

  These women were always nothing like the women I saw in real life. They always had this thing going, both physically and in other ways which I feel a lot of women could neverrreally relate to or aspire to be or even tap into to draw strength from, but instead could only fantasize about.

  But Brie!!! For me, Brie's a major deviation from all that and it scares a lot of people that such a powerful character, one powerful enough to turn the tides in Avengers: Endgame, is played by such a ""Gentle-Faced"" woman, a woman whose face and appearance every female out there could look at, connect with and remain comfortable in their own skins. A real woman just like them. 😊

  I say what better way to pomote feminism and fight sexism, what better way to show women how powerful every single one of them can be, what better to tell them ""hey u don't have to look smoking hot, or look all badass to be strong"". The point is all women can choose to be strong and as well deserve to be, and I think picking Brie even with her ""gentle face"" to play Captain Marvel goes a long way to send the message across loud and clear!!!

606,"  I intend keeping this one short and simple.

  So I was surfing through the net and I come across a post concerning a recent suggestion that Superman be played by Michael Bakari Jordan (Killmonger from Black Panther). With the recent departure of Henry Cavill from playing DCEU'S Man of Steel, the boots have been left empty and a lot of names have been flung around as to who should fill them but none has been piqued my interest than this suggestion for Michael Jordan, a black, to play Superman.
  At first glance I laughed myself to death, it sounded totally ridiculous to me and I must say it does to anyone who hears that. But then after reading few comments on the subject, it got me thinking what if Superman was black? 🤔
  Thinking about it led me to realize and conclude, superheroes were never race restricted, at least ""The Man from Krypton"" isn't. I mean who knows, who knows what the people of Krypton looked like and what color of skin or eyes they had. Sure someone or rather people have told stories portraying Superman as white, but what we have to understand is that, superheroes are not the in people/race /color they are or the powers they wield but rather in the ideals they carry and represent and I say these ideals can manifest in whatever skin color and race such characters are chosen to be portrayed as. So as hard as it will be for I and the worldwide audience to accept such change, not like change is always exactly fun, I say ""Yes to MICHAEL BAKARI JORDAN as Superman!"", ""Yes to Black Superman!""
  Although we might not expect such a movie anytime soon,but I think it's a good idea worth thinking about and discussing.🤓☕"

608,"Two mid-majors received a desperately needed win that should put their teams in position to be a part of this year's NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament if they do not pick up a bad loss in the next couple of weeks.
First, University of Central Florida (UCF) was able to break the 33-game home winning streak of #8 Houston with a 69-64 victory. Showing that they could beat a ranked team, UCF now has two games left to play in the regular season. If they win one of the next two games, then they will secure third place in the American Athletic Conference (AAC). Aaaaack!
Then, Utah State also received a signature victory at home against #12 Nevada by winning 81-76. The Aggies showed how much they have improved because they lost by 23 to Nevada about two months ago. This win puts Utah State in a tie with Nevada for the Mountain West regular season title. The fans at Utah State showed their appreciation by rushing the court after the game was over. However, they showed too much appreciation by pushing Nevada players. The Nevada players almost would have recreated 'The Malice at the Palace' debacle if they would have punched a fan. Fans should not be allowed to storm the court, but this dumb tradition will not be stopped until a fan is clocked.
These two victories will put pressure on the other teams on the bubble because two more open spots in the bracket have been potentially filled. The bubble teams in the major five conferences will have to step their game up if they do not want to be snubbed."

Williamson will be out with a mild knee sprain. Nike, what are you doing?

610,"The Europa League Round of 16 Draw was held earlier today at the UEFA Headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. The draw was held by UEFA personnel along with this year's Europa League ambassador, former Valencia and Sevilla goalkeeper Andres Palop. Here are the results of the draw. The matches will be played on March 7th and March 14th.
Match 1: Chelsea FC (ENG) vs FC Dynamo Kyiv (UKR)
Match 2: Eintracht Frankfurt (GER) vs FC Inter Milan (ITA)
Match 3: GNK Dinamo Zagreb (CRO) vs SL Benfica (POR)
Match 4: SSC Napoli (ITA) vs FC Salzburg (AUT)
Match 5: Valencia CF (ESP) vs FC Krasnodar (RUS)
Match 6: Sevilla FC (ESP) vs SK Slavia Prague (CZE)
Match 7: Arsenal FC (ENG) vs Rennes (FRA)
Match 8: FC Zenit (RUS) vs Villareal (ESP)
The best matchup out of this draw is definitely Eintracht Frankfurt versus Inter Milan. Plenty of goals should abound in both legs of this matchup. With Palop helping with the draw, the results could be seen as a coincidence that Valencia and Sevilla received the two easiest matchups.

612,"Liverpool jumps back to the top spot in the Premier League with a 3-1 victory on the road over Southampton Friday evening. Although the score shows that Liverpool won this game by a two-goal margin, the game was much closer than what the score indicates.
Southampton was able to strike first with a Shane Long goal in the ninth minute. Long received a wonderful pass from Pierre Hojbjerg to quickly put the Saints ahead. This game was a typical trap game for Liverpool since they are playing Porto in the Champions League quarterfinals next week. Instead of remaining complacent, Liverpool was able to tie the score in the 36th minute with a score from Naby Keita. This goal was very important because it was Keita's first goal and because his play will add more midfield depth for the club down the stretch.
The score stayed knotted at one until 80th minute when Mohamed Salah put the ball into the net. The go-ahead goal gave Salah his first goal in about a month. After breaking his slump, Jordan Henderson was able to score again in the 86th minute to put the game away.
Liverpool is now two points ahead of Manchester City with little more than a month to play. Southampton really needs points as they remain five points out of the relegation zone ahead of Cardiff City. Here are the starting lineups from the match. Although Southampton scored quickly, they played a defensive 5-4-1 formation while Liverpool went with their standard 4-3-3 lineup.
Southampton - Goalkeeper: Gunn. Defenders: Yoshida, Bertrand, Valery, Vestergaard, Bednarek. Midfielders: Redmond, Hojbjerg, Ward-Prowse, Oriol Romeu. Forward: Long.
Liverpool - Goalkeeper: Alisson. Defenders: Matip, Van Dijk, Alexander-Arnold, Robertson. Midfielders: Keita, Fabinho, Wijnaldum. Forwards: Salah, Firmino, Mane."
614,"The first round of the 2019 Men's National Invitation Tournament (NIT) begins tonight. For those teams that believed that they were slighted by not reaching the field of 68, they now have a chance to show everyone that they can play. Here are my picks for the first round.
Hofstra at NC State. Hofstra will not be able to sneak up on NC State because Wolfpack coach Kevin Keatts used to coach at UNC-Wilmington two years ago in the same conference as Hofstra. Hofstra will not be taken lightly so I have to pick North Carolina State.
Lipscomb at Davidson. I really like Lipscomb in this match-up because Lipscomb mixes up their offensive game a little bit better.
Campbell at UNC Greensboro. One man will not be able to defeat a team, even if that man is Chris Clemons. Pick: UNC Greensboro.
St. Francis (PA) at Indiana. The pick is Indiana.
Wright State at Clemson. This game will have some sentimental value as Clemson coach Brad Brownell used to coach at Wright State. Clemson is horrible in close games as the Tigers lost five conference games by two points or less. I will pick Wright State.
San Diego at Memphis. I will pick Memphis this year as San Diego underachieved in WCC play.
South Dakota State at Texas. Mike Daum, please put an end to Texas' miserable season. Pick: S. Dakota State.
Loyola (IL) at Creighton. In an old-school MVC matchup, Creighton is now in the Big East after leaving the Valley. However, Loyola (IL) has not recovered the magic from last season. Pick: Creighton.
Arkansas at Providence. Razorbacks F Daniel Gafford will not be playing in the NIT, which means that Providence will win.
Dayton at Colorado. The advantage of altitude always works in favor of Colorado at home.
Toledo at Xavier. This game will have some extra spice since both schools are located in Ohio. Xavier's defense should show up to slow down the offensive attack of the Rockets.
Norfolk State at Alabama. I have to pick Alabama.
Harvard at Georgetown. Hoyas all the way.
Wichita State at Furman. Over the past month, Wichita State has righted the ship and should have enough bodies to stop the offensive attack of the Paladins.
Sam Houston State at TCU. Sam Houston State, please end the misery that is known as TCU's college basketball season.
Butler at Nebraska. Nebraska has been dealing with injuries all year, but they have been playing better since the rotation has been cut down to seven players. Pick: Nebraska."
615,"Manchester United was able to bounce back after last week's loss to PSG by winning in the fifth round of the FA Cup with a 2-0 victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. This win will allow for Manchester United to advance to the FA Quarterfinals.
The match started off sort of slow for the first ten minutes as both teams were feeling each other out in this huge matchup. The jitters quickly went away during the next five minutes of the match as Chelsea forward Eden Hazard just missed a shot wide to the right and Manchester midfielder Ander Herrera had a screamer to the top right hand corner by Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. 
United was able to break through in the 31st minute when Paul Pogba put a cross in from the left for Ander Herrera, who headed the ball into the left side of the goal. Manchester then caught Chelsea sleeping right before half on a counterattack in which Marcus Rashford put in a cross to Pogba, who was able to get his own header for goal.
In the second half, Manchester played more defensive since they were already up two goals to nil. However, Chelsea could not capitalize on the prevent defense. The closest that Chelsea came to scoring was in the 55th minute when Pedro was about to kick the ball into the net about 6 yards from goal, but Manchester defender Luke Shaw was able to slide in and knock the ball away at the right moment. With the win, Manchester United continues to tread forward towards one of the biggest turnarounds in Premier League history.
Here are the starting lineups from the match. Chelsea went with a 4-3-3 formation, while Manchester United used a 4-4-2 formation.
Chelsea - GK: Kepa. Defenders: Rudiger, David Luiz, Azpilicueta, Marcos Alonso. Midfielders: Jorginho, Kante, Kovacic. Forwards: Hazard, Pedro, Higuain.
Manchester - GK: Romero. Defenders: Shaw, Smalling, Young, Lindelof. Midfielders: Pogba, Ander Herrera, Matic, Juan Mata. Forwards: Rashford, Lukaku.

Brighton's Solly March attempted a free kick from about 30 yards from goal, and the kick appeared to be an easy save for Millwall goalkeeper David Martin. However, the goal slipped through his hands for the game to go into extra time. After the match went to penalty kicks, everyone knew that Millwall would be eliminated from the FA Cup because he was still demoralized for letting that goal in.

618,"Manchester City was able to repeat as Carabao League Cup champions with a win over Chelsea via penalty kicks. Neither team scored during the match and extra time. Manchester City squeaked by 4-3 on penalty kicks. However, the most exciting part of the match occurred right after the second period of extra time ended.
Chelsea coach Mauricio Sarri was looking to substitute another goalkeeper in for Kepa Arriazabalaga. Kepa had played admirably to that point because he was keeping shots out of goal even though he was experiencing leg cramps. The leg cramps hurt so much that Kepa went to the ground twice in pain. The problem was that Kepa refused to leave after the substitution was put on the board. He continued to wave off the coach by claiming he was ready to go.
Of course, Kepa lost this match for Chelsea. To make matters even worse, Chelsea backup goalkeeper Willy Caballero used to play for Manchester City before he moved on to Chelsea. Caballero would have had more of a sense of where the Manchester City players would have been kicking the ball on those penalty shots. Sarri wishes that he was back in Serie A.

709,"Veteran actor and stand up comedian, Okey Bakassi, has said that it is unfair to compare Nigeria&rsquo;s movie industry to its American counterpart.
Speaking on the sidelines of the premiere of Avengers: Endgame organised by the US consulate at Filmhouse Cinema, Oniru, he said Hollywood has had years of experience.
According to him, &ldquo;Nollywood is doing an amazing job of telling African stories, specifically Nigerian stories. Nobody else can tell it better than us"".
He said &ldquo;So to draw a comparison won&rsquo;t be fair on Nollywood. They (Hollywood) themselves had many years of cinematography, advancement in technology. It&rsquo;s not a fair comparison"".
Continuing, he said ""they (Hollywood) are telling their stories the way they want to tell their story. We are here telling our stories. These are two different things. But in technology, they are way ahead. So Nollywood is doing fantastically well, (there&rsquo;s) a lot of room for improvement.&rdquo;
&lsquo;Avengers: Endgame&rsquo; is the final sequel to Marvel&rsquo;s 2012 movie, &lsquo;The Avengers&rsquo;
Commenting on the movie, he said: &ldquo;You know when you&rsquo;re seeing a movie like this which is the coming together of how many years of work, and you&rsquo;re finally seeing like the ending, you know different layers of emotions will move in your head. So you probably need to sit down again and see it without expectations to get a clearer picture.
&ldquo;For some people, I&rsquo;m sure it would meet their expectations. There will always be critics who would always say it could have been like this or like that. But I think for me, they did an awesome job. I&rsquo;ll still like to see it again to be very honest.&rdquo;

619,"Here is why I will not be rooting for Juventus for the rest of this season. Last week, Juventus was playing at Cagliari. During the game, the fans from Cagliari started making monkey chants towards the Juventus players that are of African descent. To show his resolve, 19 year old striker Moise Kean scored in the 84th minute and stood in front of Cagliari fans with arms outstretched in a Jesus Christ pose. The fans absolutely were livid.
Instead of backing up their young striker of the future, Cagliari and Juventus blamed Kean for inciting the racists. Italy is so backwards. Now, I see why Italy is shaped like a boot; they have kicked common sense out of the country years ago. The worst comments came from long-time veteran Leonardo Bonucci.
""I think the blame is 50-50. Moise should not have done that and the Curva [fans] should not have reacted in that way.""
You have to be kidding me. People that are racist should always receive 100% of the blame for their idiocy. The lack of melanin has never been scientifically proven to make a person superior to another person that has melanin. If that was true, then there would not be any tanning salons in the world. What Bonucci said is so idiotic that he is still trying to backtrack on his statements. To say something so bone-headed before playing Ajax in the Champions League will be a distraction that the club will not be able to overcome.
Italy, fix your stuff before your economy collapses."
620,"What a way to start off the UFC being on ESPN! The UFC (Ultimate FIghting Championship) held their first event on ESPN after switching from Fox Sports. Last night, mixed martial arts (MMA) was put on full display at the Talking Stick Resort in Phoenix, AZ. In the main event, former UFC heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez (14-3) was going up against former title contender Francis Ngannou (13-3).
Both fighters were facing a crossroads moment in their careers. Velasquez had not fought since 2016 due to dealing with back injuries. Before the injuries, Velasquez was considered the best heavyweight in his era. For Ngannou, he was looking to bounce back from two very lackluster performances last year in which his inexperience showed. Even though Ngannou possesses the most power possibly ever seen in MMA history, he did not know how to use that power properly as he would either gas out from throwing so many wild punches or he would not throw punches because of the fear of losing all of his stamina for the fight.
Nevertheless, when the fight began, Velasquez seemed to have plenty of ring rust because his strategy was all wrong. Usually, Cain would start out with punches in bunches which would lead to an easy takedown. Then, he would be able to dominate the entire round on the mat. However, he came out throwing kicks because he did not want to enter into Ngannou's punching range. When Ngannou saw that Velasquez was not going for the takedown, then he was able throw punches. Once one of those punches connected, the fight was over that quick.
Ngannou hit Velasquez so hard with a one-two combination that Velasquez's knee gave out. The fight was over in 26 seconds. For now, Ngannou has silenced the critics and has once again become a contender for the heavyweight championship. For Velasquez, he will need time to recover again from another injury.

Memphis at Creighton. I give the advantage to Memphis because I think that Jeremiah Martin will be scoring plenty of points in this game.
Arkansas at Indiana. In a rematch from this year, Arkansas defeated Indiana by one point. However, Daniel Gafford will not be playing for Indiana this time, which means that the Hoosiers should roll in this game.
Lipscomb at NC Greensboro. This mid-major battle could go either way. I am picking NC Greensboro because of their defense.
Wichita State at Clemson. Wichita State will have to defeat another team from South Carolina in this round, but I think that Clemson's guards will carry the Tigers in this one.
Xavier at Texas. Xavier is looking like one of the favorites to win the NIT. I will pick the Musketeers.
Harvard at NC State. I do not think that Harvard will pull off another upset. I'm going with NC State.
Nebraska at TCU. They're trying to fire Nebraska head coach Tim Miles, but he is hanging on though. Let's go, Huskers!
Norfolk State at Colorado. As a reward for winning an exhausting overtime game against Alabama, Norfolk State has been rewarded with a game in high altitude. The Buffaloes will roll in this game."

#8 Kennesaw State (6-25, 3-13) at #1 Lipscomb (23-6, 14-2)
Stetson (7-24, 3-13) ended up being the odd team out. The Hatters now have an extra week to practice for next season. Clearly, things have been rather cloudy in the Atlantic Sun if you look at the records of this conference as a whole. FGCU and North Florida have winning records in conference, but losing records overall. Fortunately, Lipscomb and Liberty have carried the banner for the ASun. Lipscomb has defeated TCU this season, while Liberty defeated UCLA this season. The tournament will come down between these two teams. I'm picking Liberty only because CBS will lose their minds because Liberty was founded by Jerry Falwell.

627,"Campus politics have over the years produced some of the most brilliant young minds that Kenya has seen. In the past Years University students were so powerful to the extent of getting the ear of the government anytime they spoke. With time however, things have changed. From few leaders transforming from campus to National politics, from popular vote system to the new system known as the delegates system everything about campus politics is now different.
At multimedia university of Kenya (MMU), the students council elections is most awaited and anticipated event in the student&rsquo;s calendar. This event is so popular that even students meant to graduate value it more than their own graduations. The juice of the election process is not in the change of leaders but the period that proceed the voting day 
In the oat, scene of drunk students, empty classes and noisy environment characterized the whole month in which campaigns were conducted.it would not be unusual to find a shaggy students with unkempt hair, half buttoned shirts, a pair of Tron trousers and in slippers or Sandals shouting the name of their favourite candidates at midnight near the university hostels. In return the &ldquo;goons&rdquo; as they are popularity referred to they buy a bottle of alcohol that keeps them going.
At the famous university eatery popularly known as &ldquo; Chafua&rdquo; the start of the elections period signals the beginning of free meals to some students. This group often leaves classes early and head for the famous joint here they await to see any aspirant who has shown interest in any of the student&rsquo;s council position. At the sight of one, the 'human predator' will approach unlike animal predator they opt to approach with praises as opposed to violence. Saying no to this group demands can only be equated to committing political suicide. They will tarnish your name so quickly to the extent that you be left wondering if they are the same people who were showing you with praises with big names like &ldquo;kiongozi&rdquo; and &ldquo;mkubwa&rdquo;.
The election debate day is the epitome of the election period. On this day aspirant are out to prove their financial muscle, big Cars branded t-shirt and banners are a common feature in this day. According to Valentine Mugun the presidential candidate in the last conclude election said she had to get a fuel guzzled, a range Rover sport so as to make a statement ,&rdquo; At this point most of my opponents associated my campaigns with a lot of money, all I want to do is to prove them right.&rdquo;
How students get the money for fund their campaigns or what interest their sponsor have in students politics is still a riddle. With the introduction of the delegates system, the whole process has been decentralized the attention has been shifted to the Electoral College. All the money now goes towards bribing of the 66 delegates from different faculties on the final day of election, aspirants look for posh houses with furniture&rsquo;s that suggest affluence. They then invite the elected delegates for a meal and a few bottles of alcohol meant to win their loyalty. Aspirant gooses have been cooked. 
On the elections day the atmosphere is tensed people just wait to see who trounced the other? Celebration break at around midday when the elections results are announced. The looser concentrate on paying the debts while the winner await the swearing in in which marks the end of one electioneering process and the beginning of another.
The power &ldquo;wise men&rdquo; social media in campus politics 
The power of money, social media and the self-proclaimed generals has played a critical role in multimedia university of Kenya student&rsquo;s politics as the aspirant play hard to win the heart of the self-proclaimed generals. The generals are moneyed individuals who has a huge social media following that tends to influence thousands of students following them on the social media. Words of wisdom fly from one end of the school to the other end. Well, they start with a catchy introductory phrase such as &ldquo;Comrades Power, comrades tibim&rdquo; however much shy and brave you can be you can never teach a comrade to be an intellect. According to Mr Adande also known as Balukutu, your past heroic in organization successful students protest and standing to the aid twisting tactic successful students protest and standing for the Comrades is the only factor that can make student to love you and working against the administration should always precede you, said Adande the former secretary general of multimedia university students union. Whose efforts to be cleared to run for the second term as the secretary general went down the drain for unknown reasons? 
The Gem realized that many aspirants are going to the extent of figuratively breaking banks so as they can hire influencers and campaign managers.
According to Bob shikuku senior Comrades demand various benefits this benefits entails: taking them out for shopping, paying their rent, they ensure their friends and classmates eat for they are commonly as goons of the government to some extent some claim their boyfriend or girlfriends are taken care of during the campaign period said Bob shikuku president multimedia university of Kenya.
The senior Comrades are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that the aspirant posters are free from vandalization. The aspirant are mandated to pay up to a sum of sh.4, 000 per night to protect posters and banners from been destroyed. &ldquo;It is very expressive to protect banners and posters than printing them&rdquo;, Said Bob Shikuku.
In as much as MMU is vibrant when it comes to the game of politics university of Nairobi (UON) must not be left behind as it the most popular institution where politics is valid and of high voltage.
Other than influencers, aspirant also money to maintain their prances on social media through hiring of bloggers who show them praises as they speak Ill about their aspirant.
MMU swaggers is a Facebook page whose administrator is one other than the former student of mmu and former finance secretary multimedia university of Kenya student association ( MUKSA) multimedia multimedia swaggers it is the hub of information in the institution. He emphasizes on heaven individual who has a huge online presence is a big deal when it&rsquo;s a camping period. Furthermore he explains how much a blogger can get paid salary of sh.1000 to sh.2000 on a daily basis. Moreover, he fears that students Barazas are slowly been overturn by online campaign.
The role of political class in campus 
A major change has now been expected on how the university politics is how carried out. This was evidently seen during the 2017 when the parliament passed the university amendment laws (Amendment) Act,2016, this act significantly affected the way students politics and consequently social life, is managed and regulated that will definitely have significant consequences for the university community and the country in future. The change in laws will definitely affect how the campaigns have been carried 
For instance you find a university students particularly in multimedia university having expensive cars others use millions of money to run there camping&rsquo;s. The big question has always been who is sponsoring this students.
According to Bob shikuku president multimedia university of Kenya student association (MUKSA) The act recommends that a student association shall be governed by a student&rsquo;s council comprising of: a chairperson; a deputy chair person, who shall be from different gender from that of the chairperson; treasure; a secretary-general who shall be the secretary to the council; and three members who will reprent special interest groups. The act future demands that every student council shall be elected in accordance with the act and its members shall reflect national diversity, and have not more than two thirds of its members been from the same gender. The process of electing student council shall be through Electoral College running from different faculties. For this case multimedia university have 66 delegates elected across the six faculties. 
The delegates are elected by students who will later the present the other students in electing the students council. The students have no control over the delegates as they have their rate to elect the leaders of their choice. Aspirant find it easy to to bribe the 66 delegates to vote in there side than convincing the whole school.
According to Bob shikuku the political class have found this system suitable has can manipulate the delegates to vote for their preferred aspirant.
Campaigns
The university amendments laws explains that there will be no loaded campaigns that has always been witnessed in the recent past where students invest a lot in camping&rsquo;s the new system has bring to an end the power of the &ldquo;wise men&rdquo; and the self-made general&rsquo;s. The former secretary general of multimedia university Mr Harrison Talo explain to us how important was to be elected by the majority of students as compared to the electrical college, &ldquo;you felt very proud to walk around the university hence you have been elected with majority of students, the political class and the state have ensured they have a control over some university by ensuring leader&rsquo;s elected toe there lane. They fund then and ensure they have the state security.&rdquo; Said Mr Talo.
Why do the political class have an interest in the university elections?
The political class have joined the campus politics because they want to have a control over the universities, the students leaders will easy be used to get tenders from the school.
Some trend to use students as voters in their various places. Through this there is s raise of tribalism as students will want leaders elected to be coming from the some community in just conclude election in multimedia university students were electing Electoral College representative basing on their origin.
The tribal aspect has been widely spread in the universities, as students think that elders from their community will serve their interest best. The current situation can&rsquo;t be compared as what used to happen in past, where elders were elected basing on the agendas they had to students.

628,"DRAFT NATIONAL BAMBOO POLICY

In the Company of CS for Ministry of Environment &amp; Forestry, Keriako Tobiko , H.E. Dr Wilber Ottichilo - Governor Vihiga County today attended the public participation forum on draft National Bamboo Policy 2019 and review of Draft National Forest Policy and amendments of the Forest Conservation and Management Act, 2016 at Sosa Cottages in Vihiga County.

The policy seeks to develop a vibrant Bamboo industry benefiting the present and future generations through sustainable management, increasing area grown with Bamboo and enabling commercialisation and value-addition.

Through the policy, the government will:
1. Allocate at least 10 percent of overall annual planting budget to promote Bamboo plantation.
2. Promote Bamboo planting in riparian areas and in watershed management in line with prevailing wetlands policy and regulations.
3. Mandate block planting of Bamboo in forest land above 30-degree slope along with deep rooted trees; and planting of Bamboo as farm boundaries and in terraces in farm land.

Developing human resource capital specialised in Bamboo and capacitating actors across the value-chain is critical for commercialisation of Bamboo.

Awareness on the potential and possibilities of Bamboo to a wider audience especially consumers, development partners, industry and investors is critical for developing markets as well as investments in the sector.

In Vihiga we already boast of a son of the land who discovered and is reaping from the myriad benefits of bamboo. His bamboo campaign gets a better footing for bamboo applications in Vihiga County and beyond with this policy."

631,"A new life, a fresh start
Starting your life from the beginning can be a hard thing for anyone, especially if you must move and adjust to a new setting; a new environment different from the one you grew up in and what you are used to. Be it the weather or the culture around you.
This is the life story of Brenda Chokote, a woman in her 40s who had to leave her home country of Nigeria to move to America in search for her personal freedom and in hopes to make a good life for herself. Never worked a day in her life except for minor home decoration sells here and there, she had never had the conventional 9 &ndash; 5 type job.
Brenda is the mother of three children; two in their 20s and the last in her early teenage years. She moved to America to her youngest daughter and was tasked with providing for her child and paying rent. To someone who was used to this kind of life, even if it is in different situation would be able to adapt well, but when happens to someone who doesn&rsquo;t know how this life works?
&ldquo;The struggles are enormous, like back home you can go to work 8 &ndash; 3/4 or 9 &ndash; 5 and basically you are doing nothing and at the end of the month your money comes in but here is not like that.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Here, the work is per hour, most jobs especially if you are a starter and for you to get you money at the end of the month, you will work that money; the money isn&rsquo;t just coming like that.&rdquo;
She must balance work, school and raising a young teen all by herself. As a mother you can&rsquo;t help but worry and think about how your child is doing and what she is doing at every point that you are not around.
Brenda has had her fair share of moving, from Houston where she first arrived, to Chicago in search of a good job, but ran away because of the weather and lack of transportation. She went back to Houston where she stayed for a while before moving to Katy, a town just outside Houston. She stayed there for the summer period and because there were no schools close by for her to enroll her child she had to move. She moved to Georgia as she was informed by a friend that she could stay over, have a good job and a school to enroll her child.
It is one thing for you to push yourself to work and make the best of yourself but when you have a child to think about, it&rsquo;s a whole new dynamic especially when you must move as much as you do or work as much as you do. &ldquo;My daughter is here trying to cope with the way things are done here, especially because she came here when she was in 5th grade, 10 years old. So, all her life she has been in another place and now here, so she is trying to fit in, trying to make new friends, trying to study the environment.&rdquo;
At moment Brenda lives in Georgia with her daughter and are patiently waiting for the next phase of their lives to unfold. Where would they go next? Will they have to move again soon?"
632,"Originally born in Jos, Nigeria, my family and I had to relocate to somewhere safer as we found ourselves amid perpetual war, to the point where, during our drive out of Jos, we were stopped by &ldquo;policemen&rdquo; asking us to help transport dead bodies in our car. My dad drove off speedily, telling my brother and I to keep our heads down, hoping to preserve his children&rsquo;s innocence.
We arrived in our new home, the capital of the country, Abuja, which was and is usually very calm. I was four years old when we relocated and till I was seven, I went to a normal school. Then everything changed as my parents decided that it would be better if my brother and I be homeschooled&hellip;. and so, we were.
Fast-forward six years and my parents finally had a change of heart and it was off to boarding school&hellip; in a different city. I&rsquo;m not complaining, as it was better than being homeschooled. Some people may say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it wasn&rsquo;t that bad.&rdquo; You&rsquo;d be wrong. We didn&rsquo;t school outside the house and thus, never had reason to leave the house apart from family outings and church. Coupled with the fact that my parents were the restrictive type, going out was never an option, this all meant I pretty much had no social life.
The boarding school was in Kaduna, Nigeria, which is a two-hour drive from my home. It was a major transition for me; jumping from schooling at home where it was just my family and I to schooling in a place where I had to be my own person and having to socialize more than I ever had. I went to another boarding school in my city for two years before I graduated high school.
My boarding school experience allowed me to meet people and understand the different temperaments that everyone possesses.
My parents already said I wasn&rsquo;t going school in Nigeria and so I came here, to Dubai. At least a boarding school gave me a taste of being independent, but this was more than a taste, this was a buffet, a whole new country.
My dad took me to school and stayed with me for two weeks and passed on as much information to me as he could in such a short period of time and left, I was completely alone, no family, I knew no one. My life had just begun, and I had to learn to be responsible for myself; making sure I didn&rsquo;t miss classes for anything, buying only the necessary things so as not to get stranded at any time, cooking for myself.
Four years later and I have successfully finished my university education and I&rsquo;m now seeking a job. Has it been tough? Absolutely, but it made me into the person I am now, through the abrupt changes in my life that could have made me cower, I have pushed myself through it all and now I&rsquo;m just learning what it means to stand on my own two feet."
633,"In the university, we had five choices for journalism elective courses, out of which we were required to take three. I chose &lsquo;Digital Photography&rsquo; as one of them because I knew it would be a course which I would have so much fun doing and I was right. 
The whole class was taken on a trip to a nearby Emirate, Sharjah, where an event called Expo Sharjah is held every year that showcases art in all its glory; photography, painting, design, talk shows, as well as the opportunity to experiment with cameras and even to buy them. 
As I walked round immersing myself in the works, I entered a room focused on beautiful photography. One picture stood out for me in particular; a picture of the Hatta dam. I was fascinated so I read the description and to my delight, found out it was in a neighboring Emirate which meant it would be easy for me to go there.
I was determined to see this place for myself so as soon as I got back home, I told Zayn; a friend of mine and student of the class, all about it. We did more research and found out that it was a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Dubai. We picked a day that was convenient for the both of us and set out to see this beauty. 
Conveniently, we had a class assignment that required us to go anywhere and experiment with the various settings of a camera. For me this was the perfect excuse to go on this adventure; killing two birds with one stone. 
After waiting for almost two hours at the allocated bus station, we realized that in our excitement we forgot to pack necessary things like food or water, but by the time the bus finally came, all that was at the back of our minds was out journey ahead.
The drive felt very long but our expectations and the view made it worth the while. We arrived exactly when Google said we would and brought out our phones to check for the direction leading to the dam. That was a bust however as none of us had data, so we could only follow the preloaded directions. 
It was obvious how unprepared we were but what we hoped to see was the main driver for us. The walk was eventful, we got lost a few times and had to ask around to get back on track. I wore shorts, so I would be comfortable&hellip; that was the worst choice I ever made because as we walked, people had their eyes on me. At first, I really couldn&rsquo;t be bothered but it threw me off when the policemen on duty at the dam started gushing at me, Zayn quickly gave me her jacket which I tied around my waist. 
We had walked for about 30 minutes before we reached the foot of the dam. We began to climb to the top with a few pauses as we needed to catch our breath. At the top the view was all I had imagined; it was worth every step.
The view was amazing with the large body of turquoise water below, the bright blue sky with not a single cloud in sight and mountains that surrounded us like a cover; all these elements worked together to create a beautiful picture. 
I spent only five minutes taking pictures as this was still an assignment. As soon as I was done, I met up with Zayn and we began our journey back. The walk back felt shorter, but we had to wait for the bus for another two hours. 
It was night time when we began the bus ride home and the road looked scary, plus we were the only ones on the bus, so Zayn and I decided to take precautionary safety measures by taking shifts looking out to make sure the bus driver wasn&rsquo;t taking us in the wrong direction. I took the first shift, letting Zayn sleep, when I was sure things looked alright, I woke her, so I too could rest my eyes. 
We arrived back in Dubai safely but extremely tired. The next day my whole body was sore, but it was worth it."

Nature has blessed humanity with countless special and salient creatures, with every creature exhibiting its wonderful features. But one creature that has never stopped to fascinate humanity or the world is WOMAN. Their peculiarity gives life to the world. In fact they are the most special Homo sapiens to be created. Sometimes, I can&rsquo;t imagine how the world will be without them. Well, my curiosity about them gave birth to five things they will always leave with.
The first thing you can never take from women is their HOSPITABILITY. One significant thing you can&rsquo;t take from women is their hospitality and great care. It is therefore not surprising that much importance is always attached to mother&rsquo;s day. A woman will readily accommodate freely any stranger without being suspicious. They like to care for all, irrespective of who you are, where you are coming from and how you are. Most often than not, this is fuelled by their compassion and love for the human race. They are concern a lot about what someone thinks and how the person feels.
Another interesting part of women you can&rsquo;t take away is their DECISION MAKING ABILITIES. Generally, women attach much seriousness to whatever they do and as such they are always almost the best decision makers. They scrutinize options carefully before choosing an option. They spend more time finding out about something they wish to engage in.
Furthermore, one feature that will always remain with women is their MOOD SWINGS. This is where they experience rapid change in their mood. This can be a good trait or a bad trait, depending on how an individual use it. What is more dangerous is that most women don&rsquo;t realize they are suffering from mood swings. Mood swings in women are caused by numerous factors but key among them is more related to their emotional instabilities. 
Again, another thing that has become permanent with ladies is that, they love to TALK. This in all sense and right is not bad. Talking affects us positively in many ways. Unfortunately many people are with the misconception that as soon as you see women engaged in a hearty conversation, they are gossiping. Women always love to share their experience and thoughts. They always want be entertained or entertain someone with hearty conversations. One great thing about talking is that it exposes them to new ideas and new methodologies.
Moreover, one fundamental attributes women will die with is their DESIRE AND ABILITY TO KEEP FRIENDS. Women always want to keep their friends close irrespective of their sexes. Most often than not, they will fight all odds to protect their friend&rsquo;s interest. It is therefore not surprising that most of them feel devastated and emotionally broken when their friends disappoint them. Women are likely to share more secrets with their friends than even their siblings and family. They automatically take their best of friends to be their family member.
Finally, women care more about HOW THEY LOOK. Women will spend even their last coin towards looking great and attractive even when they are married. They spend more time dressing up and making up just to look their best. It will not be surprising that they spend more money looking better than what they feed on. If they are looking good and have nothing to eat, they are ok.

These are my 6 facts about ladies. What do you think?

635,"Even though we are made to believe that age is just a number, it is very serious issue particularly in the African setting. Those older usually have the lion's share and the best of everything. They are more privileged, believed to be more experienced, matured and of course responsible.


In some cases, it is believed that older people are more ripe for marriage than younger people because they appear to be better off in their choices having had their share of life experiences.

How about in the work place? Ideally, one is supposed to have a boss that is older and more experienced. That way you don't feel intimidated or envious. And then the workplace would be conducive and less tense since you know your place. But what happens when it is the reverse?

For Betty, as she welcomed the new year, it was time for her to make a shift from her comfort zone in her workplace. Having spent five years in the same position,with no promotion, no form of visible growth and to top it all boredom of the highest order due to doing the same routine week in, week out, she thought it best to seek for another job. This time, she aimed for a higher position with obviously a higher pay in a new establishment.

She was fired up. You know the new year feeling, when you feel motivated to pursue new goals. One of her goals was to make the switch into better establishment with better opportunities, exposures, skill acquisitions and mouth-watering worker's package.

As she made adjustment to her CV, she embarked on a job search, sent in her applications, kept her fingers crossed while hoping for positive outcomes. Soon, her phone beeped, it was a message that she had been shortlisted for a job interview in three days time.

Her next move was to prepare for the interview as the day drew closer. The day before her interview, after ironing her wear for the interview, she packed all the needed items into her handbag. Looking at the mirror, to see her facial expressions and body language as she rehearsed possible answers, she felt confident that she would definitely get the job.

Fast forward to the D-day, she woke up quite earlier than usual, performed her morning routines and left for the job interview. Thankfully, she got there on time. She would have been disappointed if she had allowed the traffic show its ugly head. She was the first candidate at the job interview. That was a good sign for her. Taking a deep breath before she was called upon, Betty maintained her composure and calmness.

Then, the time drew near and she was ushered in to meet the interviewer. As she opened the door, she was shocked to her bone marrow. The interviewer was a much younger lady than herself. Betty was in her mid thirties and the interviewer should be around her mid twenties. In her mind, she was like 'What does this one know?'

Looks can be deceiving, true! but she was sure than she was very much older than the interviewer. She had already started calculating how she would be saying 'Yes Ma' and taking orders from this young lady.

Based on the research that she conducted on the establishment, she was expecting to meet with the Managing Director. It was later that she learnt the person had retired recently before handing over to his daughter and that was the person interviewing her.

Even though, several thoughts were going through her head, Betty carried on with the interview professionally. She saw that the lady in question, even though younger, demonstrated competence, high level of expertise and IQ. She didn't know whether she would like to work for someone younger than herself.

Being the eldest child in her family, she wasn't answerable to her younger siblings, who looked up to her for virtually everything. This was going to be a tough pill to swallow if she lands the job.

As she left the place of her job interview, pride crept in and Betty muttered that she would not like to work for someone younger than herself. It was 'unto the next one for her'. She took time to google her interviewer name and what she saw was very impressive. Her academic and professional qualifications were no where near hers yet she was older. For her, it was a wake up call, to acquire more skills, do a professional course, go for a higher degree, anything to step up her game but working for her junior, obviously a no-no.


On the flip side of side, we see older women getting married to much younger men acknowledging them as the head and being submissive, so then why is it difficult for people to work for younger bosses in the workplace?

636,"I belong to the generation of childrengroomed by moonlight storytelling and folktales. Whenever the moon showed its beautiful face, I would sit on the stool together with my siblings and be blessed by folktales courtesy my father.
These folktales were not mere entertainment, and the songs that accompanied them made them more interesting and unforgettable. Till date, I can still sing the songs like it was just yesterday. Somehow, it felt odd listening to folktales with power supply, with darkness seeming somehow necessary for a wonderful ambience. The rays from the moon were more than enough. There were no distractions from television programs.
With this present generation&rsquo;s attachment to social media, the art of telling folktales is gradually dying, if not dead. Iremember vividly that the school curriculum, too, left free periods for storytelling. It was something we looked forward to after tasking our brains with tough arithmetic questions and other subjects. It was another world of its own. Every pupil had a chance to tell his/her own story. We loved the part we had to sing-along and mimicthe storyteller.
Folktales usually landed with force and power. In the animal kingdom, the tortoise was always the wise yet lazy one. Sometimes he won, other times he lost. And the lion? It always maintained its number one position as the king of the jungle.
Folktales gave explanations to creation. It answered why the ground separated from the sky. Why the moon shines in the night and the sun by day. Why the fishes swim in the water and birds fly in the sky. Why the zebra has stripes, and the leopard has spots. Why the tortoise back is rough and why the elephant has a long nose. Why the yam plant coils around the bamboo stick. Folktalesexplained all these and morein an amusing yet educational way.
The story of the how a small tilapia fish killed a big shark is still fresh in my memory. It showed that being big does not determine one&rsquo;s ability. As small as the tilapia fish was, it killed a shark with its fins and bones. The lesson learnt here is clear.Don&rsquo;t allow your size determine your ability. Courage is on the other side of fear. Use what you have to get what you want. I could go and on. This story is even more exciting because it has a song in my native dialect.
Another story I won&rsquo;t forget in a hurry is that of the jealous wife. A man and his two wives with their children lived in a small village faraway. On one particular day, the first wife went farming. A thirsty angel paid her a visit. Being the nice woman thatshe is, she left what she was doing to get him water to the drink. To show gratitude, the angel directed her to a hut where she asked to choose among different pots of luck. The poor woman opted for the smallest pot ignoring the big ones because she was unselfish. Following the instruction of the angel, when she got home, she broke the pot. It brought goodwill, fortune, wealth and everything she ever desired. Her husband was pleased with her. This made the other wife jealous. After eavesdropping at the conversation between the first wife and her husband, the other wife followed suit and sought her fortune.
She set out to farm at the same spot where the first wife went. Luckily for her, the angel appeared again, looking worn-out and full of thirst. Ignoring his state and pleas for help, the other wife continued farming.
Seeing that the woman had no time for him, the angel directed her to the same hut to choose the pot of luck of her choice. She was so greedy she opted for the biggest pot in the hut. Disobeying the instructions of the angel, she was quick to break the pot of luck before reaching home.
You know what happened right? The pot of luck brought her everything bad. Misfortune, pain, death of her children, poverty, every bad thing you can think of. It was so terrible her husband had to send her away.
The moral of the story was that we show kindness to everyone. Be selfless and don&rsquo;t allow greed to creep in. I must admit that folktales of this nature helped shaped my character. As a foodie, sometimes I am tempted to be so greedy, buy I realize that I must always remember the other person. I apply this rule during buffets especially.
While folktales are dying, we must not forget that it is another way of preserving our culture and tradition. With the dearth of our native dialect, folktales serve as an avenue to revive this anomaly. Speaking of moral decadence in the society, the lessons from folktales have in several ways helped shaped behavior and develop character.
As much as this present generation is so obsessed with social media, the place of folktales shouldn&rsquo;t go with the wind. The moonlight blessings, the pleasure of listening to folktales from our elders, and the leisure of being in the company of one&rsquo;s age group add up to make this tradition one that should be upheld from generation to generation.

637,"It was a matrimony in death.
It had always been my dream to get married on a ship.
Sail away into &lsquo;ever-after&rsquo; paradise
Alas. It was a sail into after alright: the &lsquo;after-life&rsquo;
Oh, don&rsquo;t we look good together?
There&rsquo;s a reason why they watch all night long.
The statue that represented our love; a love we could never seal in marriage.
The ship sank as the Priest said the words &lsquo;I now pronounce you&hellip;&rsquo;
Now I&rsquo;m a wondering soul, yearning to hear the last words
&lsquo;Man and wife&rsquo;

638,"Before he murdered 11 innocent people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh last week, Robert Gregory Bowers shouted: &ldquo;All Jews must die!&rdquo;
The shooting is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in United States history, demonstrating a need for the nation &mdash; especially young people &mdash; to band together against anti-Semitic attacks.
Closer to USC, the Beth Jacob temple in Irvine was vandalized last Wednesday. The vandals, who have yet to be apprehended, spray painted the words &ldquo;Fuck Jews&rdquo; on the side of the temple, just days after the Pittsburgh attack.
Anti-Semitic crimes are all too common across the United States and take up far too many pages of our history books.
According to the FBI, Jewish people make up less than 3 percent of the total United States population, but of all religiously motivated hate crimes, over half are committed against the Jewish community.
The slaughter of Jews during the Christian Crusades, the burning of Jews during the Spanish Inquisition, the pogroms against Jews in 19th and 20th century Russia and the genocide of six million Jews at the hands of the Nazi Party are just some of the many instances of anti-Semitism that stain the pages of human history.
In 2018, anti-Semitism has once again reared its ugly head.
People cannot simply stand by and watch their Jewish brothers and sisters once again become victims of those who subscribe to this ancient and vile form of bigotry.
To defend these people of around 15 million, it is crucial to be honest about why this tiny ethno-religious community has been consistently and virulently met with violence and persecution.
Religion, particularly stemming from Judaism&rsquo;s daughter religions Christianity and Islam, is largely to blame for the piles of dead bodies left behind because of anti-Semitic movements throughout human history.
The man who committed the synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh last week was an avid social media user. Bowers frequented the social media website Gab, which is popular among those on the far right. His Gab account description read &ldquo;Jews are the children of Satan (John 8:44). The Lord Jesus Christ [has] come in the flesh.&rdquo;
Many Christian scholars have denounced Bowers&rsquo; interpretation of the verse, but his use of scripture as justification for committing an atrocity against the Jewish people is just one of many examples. One of the Nazi Party&rsquo;s favorite biblical passages was Matthew 27:25, which reads: &ldquo;All the [Jews] answered, &lsquo;[Jesus&rsquo;s] blood is on us and on our children!&rsquo;&rdquo; This passage echoes the long-held belief among Catholic clergy members that the Jews were collectively guilty of &ldquo;killing Jesus.&rdquo;
In Islam, anti-Semitic propaganda is produced daily and justified by their holy books. Quran 2:61 states that the Jews &ldquo;disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.&rdquo;
Many Islamic political factions in the Middle East are also blatantly anti-Semitic. For example, Hamas is an Islamofascist political party that is currently in control of the Gaza Strip. The group is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood and is an explicitly Islamic organization. Hamas says in Article 7 of its charter that &ldquo;&lsquo;The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight Jews and kill them.&rdquo;
The problem with anti-Semitism is vast and deeply complex. To blame any single factor for such a large issue would be extremely reductionist and ignorant. That said, however, not recognizing the huge role religious belief plays in anti-Semitism would be equally ignorant.
Religious dogma has led to the deaths of an unimaginable number of men, women and children, and anti-Semitism is largely rooted in it.
If society is to end anti-Semitism for good it must destroy its root and stem. Generation Z must be the one to reject religious dogma as a societal norm and embrace the values of the Enlightenment and humanism. Religious ideology should be treated with suspicion and criticism, and all people should be treated with empathy and dignity.
The tragedy at the Pittsburgh synagogue last week prematurely ended the lives of 11 individuals for the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of being Jewish.
It&rsquo;s high time to stop spilling blood over dogmas rooted in century-old myths, and Generation Z ought to lead the charge against it."
639,"In the past few years, several states have pushed to either encourage or require public schools to offer Bible literacy classes to their students. Two weeks ago, President Donald Trump called the idea &ldquo;great&rdquo; in a tweet. Having taxpayer-funded Bible literacy classes in schools is not only the opposite of &ldquo;great&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s unconstitutional. If public schools adopt religious education curricula, they must implement a program similar to USC&rsquo;s curriculum, which is diverse in schools of thought beyond those that use the Bible for teaching.
USC is located in an area that is nearly 40 percent Catholic, according to the Center for Religion and Civic Culture at USC &mdash; the next most popular religious affiliation is non-denominational Christian at approximately 4 percent. In other words, University Park is heavily populated by those who believe in biblical teachings. They&rsquo;re in the overwhelming majority nationally as well, with more than 70 percent of Americans identifying as some sort of Christian, according to Pew Research Center.
While the majority of Americans are Christian, public schools still should not teach the Bible, as it would result in an illustration of tyranny of the majority, an inherent weakness of democratic systems. Majority rule allows for those in the majority to pursue their own interests, no matter the cost to the minority. This is why the Constitution and its Bill of Rights were established: to bound lawmakers to certain principles that even a majority can&rsquo;t affect.
Public education should encourage curiosity and understanding of all kinds of religious beliefs, but this can&rsquo;t be done by favoring one tradition over another in public schools. The government cannot, in good conscience, ask tax-paying citizens from other religious traditions to pay for an explicitly Bible-centric course for students. However, the government can, and should, allow public schools to offer a broad spectrum of religious education options. USC&rsquo;s School of Religion curriculum provides a perfect example.
At USC, the School of Religion offers students a variety of courses on different religious traditions. USC students can take classes on anything from Islamic mysticism to the religions of Japan. This sort of diversity, though it would have to be somewhat abridged and specified, is the kind of diversity that public schools must have if they adopt religious education curricula.
USC is a private university that can adopt any religious affiliation it wants, but it chooses to remain secular. However, students have formed dozens of religious organizations that are perfectly legitimate. Of these, there are over 40 Christian organizations and numerous others of different faiths.
If the Christian-based organizations, which are in the majority, were to petition the University to require all undergraduate students to take a course in Biblical literacy, a chunk of students&rsquo; time and tuition would go to learning about the Bible, whether they believe in it or not. The University would be biased to the Christian tradition, simply because it is the most represented in student groups. Many students, Christian or otherwise, would be outraged.
USC is a microcosm for the U.S. in this way. The Constitution states the government will have no involvement in matters of religion. If the government were to sponsor Bible classes in public schools, it would be showing preference to one tradition.
However, if the USC Interfaith Council were to petition the University to require a general religious education course that would cover all of the world&rsquo;s major religions, it would be a different story. If the U.S. government were to fund religious education for many traditions, there would be no concern about preferential treatment.
A comprehensive religious education would be beneficial for U.S. students because of religion&rsquo;s prominence in our society and current events. Religiously motivated actions plague newspaper and television headlines every day. Often, communities and cultures are shaped by their systems of belief. To assert that these ideas aren&rsquo;t important ones would be ridiculous. But when a secular government begins entertaining the idea of favoring one tradition, and does so with taxpayer money, it fails to serve its students effectively and inclusively. Public schools should aim to educate students with the diversity of belief in the U.S. in mind. In secular America, anything else would be, well, sacrilegious."
640,"According to the Center of Disease Control, cigarettes are responsible for about 480,000 deaths each year in America, and account for about 20 percent of the yearly death toll in the United States, as of 2014. The CDC estimates that over five million children in America today are expected to die prematurely from a smoking-related illness if the rate of tobacco use remains the same.
If only there were a solution &mdash; some sort of nifty alternative that delivers nicotine in the same manner as a cigarette without harmful chemicals.
Fortunately, the epidemic of tobacco-related illness and death does have a perfectly viable, and already existing, solution: the Juul. California shouldn&rsquo;t be taxing Juuls to the point where they&rsquo;re no longer accessible to people who need them most.
The device, manufactured by Juul Labs, is a compact e-cigarette that resembles a flash drive. It consists of a small battery, into which juice pods can be inserted, and subsequently consumed via inhalation. The pods contain approximately 0.7 milliliters of e-liquid with 5 percent nicotine by weight and come in a variety of flavors, including mint, mango and fruit medley. The United Kingdom&rsquo;s Department of Health reports that the Juul and products like it are at least 95 percent safer than cigarettes.
The Juul is much safer than cigarettes because it delivers nicotine to the body without combustion, a process found in smoking that produces tar and releases disease-causing chemicals like hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide. With the Juul, however, the user receives a dose of nicotine, which in and of itself is nowhere near as harmful to one&rsquo;s health, without ingesting the tar and harmful chemicals. As South African psychiatrist Mike Russell put it, &ldquo;[People] smoke for [the] nicotine, but they die from the tar.&rdquo;
The popularity of e-cigarettes like the Juul is on the rise, while cigarette use is declining. California, where about 11 percent of the population smokes cigarettes, should be thrilled. However, this is not the case.
The California government, in fact, treats the Juul as an equivalent to deadly cigarettes. Under Proposition 56, which was passed in 2016, each individual cigarette is subject to a $0.10 tax increase. This tax increase was then sloppily applied to Juul pods (and similar devices), bumping up the price up about $2 per pod.
Proposition 56 resulted in an $8 increase for each pack of Juul pods, bringing the total up to nearly $30. The average price of a pack of Marlboro Reds in California is around $8. This is a stark contrast from prices in other states, like New York, where a pack of pods is about $17, and the average cigarette pack is around $15.
It makes little sense for California &mdash; a state where according to tobaccofreekids.org, more than 40,000 individuals die each year from tobacco use &mdash; to slap such a heavy tax on the potentially life-saving Juul. It makes even less sense that they would do this while allowing cigarette prices to remain so low.
Part of the revenue collected from the Proposition 56 tax goes toward tobacco use prevention. Essentially, the government is taking money from the users of a popular, tobacco-free market substitute for cigarettes, in order to put it back into preventing people from using tobacco. However, this practice is incredibly counterproductive.
Not only is this strategy ineffective in preventing tobacco use, but it also drives potential tobacco users back into tobacco use. The choice for nicotine addicts is this: Spend $25 on three packs of cigarettes, or $30 on one pack of Juul pods. The choice is relatively clear for any economic-minded consumer.
The state government ought to incentivize the purchase of Juul and similar devices instead of cigarettes in order to curb the tens of thousands of deaths each year that result from tobacco use. At the very least, the state shouldn&rsquo;t tax a market substitute for cigarettes, which is estimated to be about 95 percent safer than cigarettes, at the same level it taxes cigarettes. If it&rsquo;s a matter of revenue, split the difference; bump up the tax on actual tobacco cigarettes and decrease Juul pod prices so that they&rsquo;re at least on par with one another. 
For the sake of public health, for the sake of the lives of millions of smokers across the state, state legislators must exclude Juul pods from the Proposition 56 tax. Juul is not part of the problem, but part of the solution."
641,"The world we live in today has evolved so much over the years, there has been so much positive change in favour of women but we must question ourselves and ask why the world hasn&rsquo;t moved past child marriages. Child marriage is any formal marriage or informal union where one or both of the parties are under a certain age, specified by several global organizations such as UNICEF as minors under the age of 18. Child marriages are not limited to countries, cultures and religions, it is a global issue. It is fuelled by gender inequality, poverty, traditions, and insecurity and unfortunately each year 12 million girls are forced into marriages before the age of 18. That is 23 girls every minute and nearly 1 every 2 seconds.

The History
Though increasingly frowned upon across much of today's world, throughout history child marriages have been commonplace in many cultures. Throughout history till the 20th century, child marriages were the norm in most parts of the world and still is as long as there is parental consent. In the U.S the ages for males and females to marry differ in some states for example in New Hampshire, the ages at which you may get married with parental consent are 14 for males and 13 for females. In Kansas and Massachusetts, the age for marriage with consent is 14 for males and 12 for females. For unions in the states of California, Colorado, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas may get married at any age with parental consent. 
History justified child marriages by blaming the low life expectancy levels during those times for being only 40 to 45 years of age, child marriages were the faster way to reproduce. Girls were usually married off as soon as they reached puberty or sometimes even prior to that. In the 20th century, however, as countries started developing and as education became widespread. Women's rights slowly began to follow, starting with the right to an education then to vote and as they become part of the workforce. Their economic conditions improved, and there were massive improvements in average life expectancy due to advanced medical practices, the practice of child marriages began to be questioned. Regardless of al these life improvements child marriages still happen to this day.

Where child marriages are most common
Though the incidence of child marriage has decreased in most parts of today&rsquo;s world, it is still highly prevalent in some developing nations like many countries of Africa, South, West and Southeast Asia, South America, and Oceania. As per UNICEF&rsquo;s, State of the World's Children, 2017 report countries with the highest rates of child marriage before 18 years of age included Niger (76%), the Central African Republic (68%), and Chad (67%) holding the top 3 positions. Other countries with high rates of child marriage include Bangladesh (65%), Mali (55%), Guinea (52%), South Sudan (52%), Burkina Faso (52%), Malawi (50%), Somalia (45%), Ethiopia (44%) and Mauritiana (37%). India continues to have exceptionally high rates of child marriage as well, reaching in excess of 50% in many rural parts of the country.

Shocking examples of child marriages
SADIA&rsquo;S STORY - &ldquo;My name is Sadia and I was a child bride. I&rsquo;m now 16 years old, and have lived all my life in a small village in Bangladesh.&rdquo;I was married at 14. My husband, Sumon, is four years older. I didn&rsquo;t know him before we were married, I had never seen him before. I enjoyed school, especially maths, which was my favourite subject. But in 8th grade, I was suddenly told by my parents that I had to quit.It was terrible for me to have to sit inside and watch my friends going to school. I did not complain and did what my parents told me. I think it was four or five days after I left school that my grandmother told me what really was going on. I was shocked and completely devastated. &ldquo;Marry? Me?&rdquo; But I said nothing to her. When I was officially a married woman, I cried.
When Sadia found out she was pregnant, she said she felt completely helpless. I was just a child! I knew nothing of the duties as a mother, &ldquo;how would I do this? What if I did not love my child enough?&rdquo;
Towards the end of the pregnancy, the baby stopped moving. When I had not felt any signs of life in two days, my mother took me to the hospital. There, I got a bit of a shock.It turned out that there was no amniotic fluid left. I was told that if I give birth at home now, neither I nor the child would survive. This was scary for me to hear. The reality was brutal. However, Habiba was born by caesarean section at the hospital that day, and thank God, we both survived.
I have become accustomed to my new life. Nonetheless, i want to spread the message that child marriage must be stopped and tell people about the consequences for young brides. I might have died on the day I gave birth. No one deserves to go through what I experienced.More fathers need to know this so they do not marry off their daughters early.I dream that one day I can be a respected adult in local society. I hope we do not have to be poor anymore and that we can have a good life. But to complete school? That dream is long gone.
GLORIA&rsquo;S STORY - &ldquo;I was supposed to be in school at the time I got married,&rdquo; Gloria told Camfed. &ldquo;I was 12 years old when I got married to a 35 year old man. They said that the man would take care of me, my siblings, and my mother, due to the poverty levels.&rdquo;&ldquo;I cried because I was too young to get married,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to, I didn&rsquo;t understand the meaning of marriage, I was filled with fear.""
Rather than paying the significant dowry that Gloria&rsquo;s family had hoped for, that her mother could use to support the family, Gloria&rsquo;s new husband gave her family a single goat.In her new role as a wife, Gloria stopped going to school, and instead took care of her husband, and searched for small jobs she could do to earn some money. She and her husband struggled to earn enough to eat. But the greatest loss, for Gloria, was her freedom.
As a child bride, Gloria also endured the terror and pain of an unwanted physical relationship. After six months, she discovered she was pregnant.&ldquo;When I was pregnant I felt so much pain because I wasn&rsquo;t ready to conceive at that age,&rdquo; she said. When she was still pregnant, Gloria&rsquo;s husband died. After the funeral, his brother and successor to his land and property, married Gloria.
In her second marriage, she was often subjected to domestic violence, and she lost her baby. Under threat and oppressed, she felt unable to even seek help following her miscarriage. Years passed, until Gloria eventually became pregnant again. She was still pregnant when her second husband also died and Gloria, still only a child herself, was left alone to give birth.
&ldquo;If my child could get an education, his life would be different from mine,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;When children are kept in school, they get educated and they reap the benefits. I would like to tell others that when you get married at an early age, things are difficult and you lose all your rights and you suffer a lot.&rdquo;

Why child marriages still happen
Some of the most common reasons for this practice include gender inequality, tradition, poverty, parental consent, lack of birth registration and conflict.Gender inequality, according to Save the Children UK, Rights of Passage, In many communities where child marriage is practised, girls are not valued as much as boys, they are seen as a burden on their family. Marrying your daughter off at a young age can be viewed as a way to ease economic hardship by transferring this &lsquo;burden&rsquo; to her husband&rsquo;s family. Many parents justify that marrying their daughters young is in her best interest, often to ensure her safety in areas where girls are at high risk of harassment and physical or sexual assault.
Tradition is said to play a large role in why child marriages still happens. Child marriages are a traditional practice that in many places happens simply because it has happened for generations. A girl&rsquo;s first period can be interpreted as a sign that she is ready for motherhood in many parts of the world. However, girls are neither physically nor emotionally prepared for marriage, pregnancy and childbirth until adulthood. According to WHO, complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the second leading cause of death for girls under age 15. Despite this In some communities, when girls start to menstruate, they become women in the eyes of the community and marriage is therefore the next step towards giving a girl her status as a wife and mother.
With a mentality of trying to reduce household expenses children under the age of 18 are forced into marriages. Child marriage is most common in the world&rsquo;s poorest countries and is often concentrated among the poorest households within those countries. Child marriage is highly prevalent in Sub Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia, the two most impoverished regions of the world. In almost all developing countries, child marriage is more common among the poorest people than the wealthiest. Recent research by The National Research Council and Institute of Medicine (2005), shows that household economic status is a key factor in determining the timing of marriage for girls (along with education and urban-rural residence, with rural girls more likely to marry young). In fact, girls living in poor households are approximately twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls living in better-off households. Where poverty is severe, families and sometimes girls themselves believe that marriage will be a solution to secure their future. 
How parental consent plays a role in child marriages. Among the 190 UN member states that have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 12 per cent have no legal minimum age for marriage that protects girls under 18. Besides, many countries where 18 is the minimum age for marriage have legal loopholes which include different minimum ages for girls and boys and allow for children to marry with parental consent. Thus giving parents this decision-making power is problematic as it takes away a girls&rsquo; right to decide whether, when and who to marry.
Another factor involved in child marriage is the lack of birth registration. Globally, 230 million children under the age of 5 have never had their births registered, and more than 100 developing countries do not have efficient public birth registration systems and this means millions of children are living without a birth certificate. This is absolutely terrifying because these children do not have a shield that they can use to prove that they are merely &lsquo;children&rsquo;. Simply put if a girl cannot prove her age or identity, then who is to say her marriage is against the law?
Lastly i&rsquo;ll discuss how conflict could lead to child marriages. During times of conflict, war and civil unrest, girls become increasingly vulnerable to child marriage. Disturbance, instability, harsh living conditions, the threat of violence and poverty lead families to marry off their daughters either to protect them from potential violence or to ease financial stress. In most cases, parents think they&rsquo;re doing what&rsquo;s best for their daughter by agreeing to her marriage.

What can be done to put an end to this
In recent years child marriage has gained increasing prominence on international and national development agendas. Today, we have a unique opportunity to come together with efforts to help change the lives of girls and young women all over the world. Referring to research done by The International Centre For Research On Women (ICRW) some of the solutions to end child marriage include;
Empower girls with information, skills and support networks. By bringing girls together to learn basic skills like literacy and numeracy, how to communicate and negotiate with others, how to stay healthy during their reproductive years, how to work together to solve problems and how to earn and manage money, girls can become more knowledgeable and self-confident. By doing so this enables girls to advocate for themselves so they can make better decisions and aspire to alternatives to early marriage.
The second solution to stop child marriage is by educating and rallying parents and community members. Families and community elders are traditionally responsible for deciding when and whom a girl marries. Educating them through meetings and information campaigns about how child marriage impacts a girls health and future often sparks powerful change.
The third solution is to provide economic support and incentives to girls and their families. Parents may benefit financially from mowing the daughters of early either through gaining a bride price or simply having one less mouth to feed. Anything that enhances the economic security a poor households can aid in curbing child marriage. Providing a girl or her family with an incentive such as a loan can generate economic relief for poor families.Lastly by encouraging supportive laws and policies help strengthen and better enforce existing initiatives around girls rights.
&ldquo;For every girl whose story is told, and whose voice is heard, there are millions waiting for the world to listen.&rdquo; "
642,"According to research one doctor commits suicide in the U.S. every day -- the highest suicide rate of any profession. And the number of doctor suicides is 28-40 per 100,000. This is more than twice that of the general population and the rate in the general population is 12.3 per 100,000. If you think about it, it&rsquo;s quite disheartening that the very people who save lives basically suffer the most in silence. Doctors are perceived to be successful, smart, wealthy and immune to their own mundane everyday issues. Pamela Wible, who writes and speaks about why doctors die by suicide and why it's so often hushed up spent over five years on a quest for the truth of ""why."" He concluded, Guilt, bullying, exhaustion were big factors.
Before going into detail on factors that play a role in many suicides let&rsquo;s discuss the process of med school. Academic distress kills medical students' dreams, failing medical-board exams and not getting a post-medical-school assignment in a specialty of choice has led to suicides. Doctors can be shattered if they fail to gain a residency. Surviving med school is great and all however jumping into the field there&rsquo;s so many more triggers of suicide.
Like everyone else, doctors do have lives outside of work as normal as ours. Imagine working 60-80 or more hours per week treating patients spending day and night to make other people's lives better or more bearable. But, what about their issues ? Breakups, divorce, custody battles, court issues, family problems, illness and deaths of friends and relatives. All that is hard to balance when they&rsquo;re constantly looking out for everyone around them but themselves. The day-in-day-out stress piled with all the stress at home can lead to crippling depression and that is why doctors are far more likely than the general population to die by suicide.
People become doctors because they have a mission to help others. Failure at that could also lead to suicide, suicide becomes in their eyes the ultimate punishment. According to The Indian Sun, doctors develop on-the-job PTSD especially in emergency medicine and in doctors working in intensive care. Patient deaths even with no medical error may lead to self-loathing. Suicide notes left on bedsides and desks that read, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t fix everyone&rdquo; has got to be heartbreaking, they don&rsquo;t focus on the 150 patients they&rsquo;ve saved but the one they&rsquo;ve lost. 
Patient deaths take a toll on doctors and so do malpractice suits. Humans make mistakes. Yet when doctors make mistakes, they're publicly shamed in court, on TV and in newspapers. Many continue to suffer the agony of harming someone else unintentionally for the rest of their lives.
One really alarming discovery Wible found was that physicians report hallucinations, life-threatening seizures, depression and suicide due to sleep deprivation. As a result fatigued doctors have felt responsible for harming patients. Resident physicians are now ""capped"" at 28-hour shifts and 80-hour workweeks. If they ""violate"" work hours, they can be forced to lie on their time cards or be written up as ""inefficient"" and sent to a psychiatrist for stimulant medications. Some doctors kill themselves for fear of harming a patient as a result of their extreme sleep deprivation.
Why does this still go own? Why are the numbers so high? Why do doctors mask their pain? Simply put they don&rsquo;t want to jeopardize their medical licenses. When physicians find themselves needing counseling, the rules of the profession often deter them. If only they could speak more freely about their experiences and the issues that they might be facing it could really change their thought process before it becomes too late for them. Ignoring doctor suicides just leads to more doctor suicides, something that can be prevented by medical institutions. They need to really delve into the root of the matter and acknowledge what it is about being a doctor that can be so emotionally difficult and make changes to support the mental health of doctors and medical students. Healers, after all, also need healing. "

643,"The Daily Show&rsquo;s Trevor Noah was welcomed as a special guest in parliament by the South African President Ramaphosa. It was all smiles and applause in parliament for Noah receiving a warm welcome from all the politicians in the room. 
President Ramaphosa made a light hearted statement about the comedian;
&ldquo;Trevor, I never get this type of applause, so I am jealous. We welcome Trevor, he&rsquo;s come for an assignment, but he&rsquo;s come home as well. I had a moment to chat with him about his work. I was particularly impressed about the foundation that he&rsquo;s set up to work on education which is run by one of his colleagues, Charlene, so we applaud him for ploughing back into the country once again.&rdquo;
Ramaphosa continued by making Noah laugh saying;
&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s also here to come and look at me and all of you to make fun of me, he&rsquo;s promised that he&rsquo;s going to make fun of me. So he will stay for a while and leave at his own leisure.&rdquo;
The Foundation that the two discussed is &lsquo;The Trevor Noah Foundation&rsquo;, it is a Johannesburg-based non-profit organisation that equips orphans and vulnerable youth with the education, life skills, and social capital necessary to pursue further opportunity after graduating from high school. The foundations vision is a South Africa that advances because each generation excels beyond its predecessor. They work towards this by providing the youth with the tools, skills, and pathways to opportunity required to improve their lives and catalyze change in their communities. On the website it mentions how there is an estimated 3.7 million orphans and vulnerable children and an unemployment rate of approximately 60% for youth under 25, and it&rsquo;s the foundations goal to prevent the most South Africa's most vulnerable youth from slipping through the cracks.
&ldquo;The higher the level of education, the higher chance the youth have of creating a future for themselves and collectively, a better South Africa.&rdquo; - Trevor Noah"
644,"The water crisis in Flint, Michigan, all began in 2014, when the city switched its drinking water supply from Detroit&rsquo;s system to the Flint River to save some coin. Without treatment and testing of the water things blew up which resulted in a series of major water quality and health issues for Flint residents.
Studies showed that the contaminated water was also contributing to a doubling and sometimes tripling level of elevated blood lead levels in the city&rsquo;s children, putting the health of its youngest generation in jeopardy.
Even though with the combined power and voices of doctors, scientists, journalists, and citizen activists that shined a light on the city&rsquo;s severe mismanagement of its drinking water forcing and demanding a change the water in flint still isn&rsquo;t safe. It&rsquo;s been nearly 5 years and Flint residents are yearning to have clean water that they don&rsquo;t have to fear getting sick from. 
Because of this Jaden Smith felt a need to step in, his foundation and a church are teaming up to deliver some much needed help. Smith&rsquo;s company, Just Water, and First Trinity Missionary Baptist Church announced that they're going to bring a mobile water filtration system to Flint called The Water Box. The system is intended to reduce lead and other contaminants found in Flint&rsquo;s water, according to Detroit ABC affiliate WXYZ reports that the Water Box can produce up to 10 gallons of clean drinking water per minute allowing Flint residents to collect the water in their own containers during scheduled distribution times.
Just water was founded in 2015 by Smith and his father, Will Smith. The concept for the company stemmed from his passion to help clean up the environment. After he came into contact with all the plastic floating around in the ocean while he was surfing.
'This was a company born out of a child's love for the ocean,' Will Smith told The Associated Press during an interview as reported by the Chicago Tribune. 
Flint has been neglected for a long time in August of 2018, the NRDC and its partners went back to court to challenge Flint's ongoing response to the water crisis. As a result in February, the city of Flint agreed to implement a new statistical model that the NRDC argues will ""improve the efficiency of the City's pipe replacement program."" However, many residents say little could convince them to trust the government and drink the city's water again. ""The trust is gone for everybody,"" one Flint resident, Kaleka Lewis Harris, told NPR last October. 
But, with Jaden Smith&rsquo;s foundation the Flint residents are able to sigh in relief that they&rsquo;ve finally gotten some help."
645,"The Mexico&ndash;United States border is an international border separating Mexico and the United States, extending from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Gulf of Mexico in the east. Douglas Massey explained the U.S. fascination with its border wall by stating, &ldquo;In the American imagination the border between Mexico and the United States is a symbolic boundary between the United States and a threatening world. It is not just a border but the border.&rdquo;
The border wall was a key part of Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2015. From the moment that Trump introduced his idea for a border wall he followed it up with &ldquo;I will have Mexico pay for that wall.&rdquo; However, former Mexican President&rsquo;s Vicente Fox and Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto knocked Donald Trump's promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, reiterating that Mexico will not pay ""for that f----- wall."" ""Be clear with US taxpayers. They will pay for it,"" Fox told Trump in a tweet. Enrique Pena Nieto said he was saddened by Mr Trump's plans and added that ""Mexico does not believe in walls"".

Why did Donald Trump shut down the US Government over the Mexico border wall?
The US government shut down on December 22 after President Donald Trump and Democratic politicians hit an impasse over the president's request for $5bn in funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border, a demand Democrats oppose. Trump has so far refused to back down on the request, pushing the shutdown into its 18th day and tying the record for the second-longest gap in the US. As a result, about 400,000 non-critical employees of nine agencies were sent home without pay. While the effect of the shutdown is not felt by most Americans, millions could be hit if the shutdown does not end by February.

President Trump addressed the nation making his case for the wall 
President Donald Trump began his announcement by addressing the nation as &ldquo;My fellow Americans. Tonight, I am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day customs and border patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.&rdquo;
He continued by stating that, &ldquo;America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation.&rdquo; But justified building the wall by saying, &ldquo; all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are: African-Americans and Hispanic Americans. Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. Every week 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90% of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.&rdquo;
He continued his speech by mentioning the alarming crime rates within the last two years, &ldquo;ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now. This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.&rdquo;
He continued in attempt to plead his case by saying, &ldquo;this barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense. The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year. Vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will always be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.&rdquo;
Making it sound simple Trump went on to claim his administration is doing everything in their power to help those impacted by the situation. However emphasized that the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends the borders and reopens the government. He also claimed that the situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. &ldquo;Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security,&rdquo; Trump said.
Disagreeing on claims that building a wall is immoral Trump defends the action by saying &ldquo;people don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.&rdquo;
President Trump concluded his speech by requesting every member of Congress to pass a bill that ends the crisis. To every citizen, call Congress and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure the US border. &ldquo;This is a choice between right and wrong. Justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve. When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country. And that is what I will always do so help me God. Thank you and good night.&rdquo;

&lsquo;Much of the wall&rsquo; has already been built
Ten days into the shutdown, Trump tweeted that America should finish building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border because much of the wall is already complete. On another occasion, Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden that &ldquo;we just finished brand-new walls&rdquo; in San Diego and other parts of California. While there are some barrier structures along the southern border, no new structures have been built since Trump took office. Furthermore, while the southern border is nearly 2,000 miles long, current structures line only 654 miles of the border, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. During his 2016 campaign, Trump indicated he wanted the wall to line 1,000 miles of it.

What do the Republicans say?
Many Republicans stand by the president on his demand. Senator Lindsey Graham told CBS that he does want the government to reopen, but the ""goal is not to open up the government"", it is ""to fix a broken immigration system to bring reality to this table"". Graham added that it was ""pretty clear ... that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it"". 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has so far this year refused to bring legislation that Trump won't sign to the floor for a vote. The Republican leader is facing increased pressure from within his party, especially from vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2020, to find a solution. 
""We should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,"" US Senator Cory Gardner told The Hill on Thursday, referring to legislation to open the government while talks continue. His colleague, Susan Collins, also called for the Senate to pass the funding bills, while several other Republicans urged an end to the shutdown, the Hill and New York Times reported.

What do the Democrats say?
Democrats view a border wall as expensive and ineffective. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has called the wall ""immoral"". Instead, they said they are willing to fund security measures that do not include the wall. 
Hours after Democrats took control of the House on January 3, Democrats passed a two-bill spending package aimed at immediately re-opening the government. This includes $1.3bn for border fencing and $300m for other border security items such as technology and cameras. Democrats blame Trump for the impasse, often referring to it as ""Trump Shutdown"". 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he pressed the president on why he wouldn't end the shutdown. ""I said, 'Mr President, give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown,' Schumer told reporters in early January. ""He could not give an answer.""
In an MSNBC interview shortly after taking control of the House of Representatives, Pelosi sought to separate the issue of the wall and government funding. ""The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,"" the top Democrat said.In a rebuttal to Trump's January 8 address, Pelosi and Schumer accused Trump of dealing in ""fear, not facts"".Pelosi said Trump ""must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government"".

In conclusion building a wall is unnecessary and at this point it just feels that Trump is going to all extremes to fulfill on the message he based his presidential campaign on. By doing so it seems he has completely lost sight of the facts.
 Firstly, Illegal border crossings In 2000, 1.6 million people were apprehended trying to cross the southern border into the United States. In 2001, 1.3 million were apprehended and In 2018 Less than 400,000 these results indicate that there was a significant decline in illegal border crossing.
Secondly, according to data from the Wilson Center, as summarized by The Washington Post, &ldquo;The crime rates in U.S. border counties are lower than the average for similarly sized inland counties, with two exceptions out of 23 total.&rdquo; 
Thirdly, Trump has suggested that the flow of heroin into the United States would be restricted by his border wall. Even though 90 percent of heroin enters through the southern border they are most often hidden in legal shipments. According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, &ldquo;illicit drugs are smuggled into the United States in concealed compartments within passenger vehicles or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers.&rdquo; 
Fourthly, the wall should not be justified because migrants aren&rsquo;t sneaking across the border but rather they&rsquo;re going to the border to apply for asylum, which was a completely transparent and lawful process. 
Lastly, A mid-December poll found that 54 percent of respondents opposed Trump&rsquo;s wall.

646,"Journalist, computer programmer and activist Julian Assange, was born in 1971 in Townsville, Australia, he used his smarts to hack into the databases of many high profile organizations. In 2006, Assange founded WikiLeaks, a website intended to collect and share confidential information on an international scale, and he earned the Time magazine ""Person of the Year"" title in 2010. 
In early December 2010, Assange discovered that he had a lot of legal problems. Since early August, he had been under investigation by the Swedish police for allegations that included two counts of sexual molestation, one count of illegal coercion, and one count of rape. After a European Arrest Warrant was issued by Swedish authorities on December 6, Assange turned himself in to the London police.
Following a series of extradition hearings in early 2011 to appeal the warrant, Assange learned on November 2, 2011, that the High Court dismissed his appeal. Still on conditional bail, Assange made plans to appeal to the U.K. Supreme Court.
According to a New York Times article, Assange went to the Ecuadorean Embassy in London in June 2012, seeking to avoid extradition to Sweden. That August, Assange was granted political asylum by the Ecuadorean government, which, according to the Times, ""protects Mr. Assange from British arrest, but only on Ecuadorean territory, leaving him vulnerable if he tries to leave the embassy to head to an airport or train station."" 
The article went on to say that the decision ""cited the possibility that Mr. Assange could face 'political persecution' or be sent to the United States to face the death penalty,"" putting further strain on the relationship between Ecuador and Britain, and instigating a rebuttal from the Swedish government.
On April 11, 2019 after Ecuador announced the withdrawal of Assange's asylum ending a stay of almost 7 years, Assange was arrested by the Metropolitan Police in London on an extradition warrant from the US Justice Department. He was charged with conspiracy to attempt to hack a computer in connection with the 2010 release of classified military info obtained via Manning. Assange's attorney says the indictment is troubling because of its implications for freedom of the press. 
Ecuador&rsquo;s decision to allow police to arrest Assange inside its embassy last week followed a tense and acrimonious period of deteriorating relations between the Quito government and the house guest whom its foreign minister, Jos&eacute; Valencia, described as ungrateful, rude and unhygienic.
Ecuador said on Monday it has suffered 40 million cyber-attacks on the webpages of public institutions since stripping Wikileaks founder Julian Assange of political asylum.
Patricio Real, Ecuador's deputy minister for information and communication technologies, said the attacks, which began on Thursday, had ""principally come from the United States, Brazil, Holland, Germany, Romania, France, Austria and the United Kingdom,"" as well as from the South American country itself.
President Lenin Moreno removed his diplomatic protection following seven years of self-imposed exile in the building saying , that the country had ""reached its limit on the behaviour of Mr Assange""and accused Assange of interfering in the ""processes of other states"" and ""spying."" As well as overturning Assange's asylum status, Ecuador stripped him of the nationality he was given in 2017 under the government of Moreno's predecessor Rafael Correa. He now faces US federal conspiracy charges related to one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets.
The UK will decide whether to extradite Assange, in response to allegations by the Department for Justice that he conspired with former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to download classified databases. He faces up to five years in US prison if convicted on the charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.
Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a ""dangerous precedent"" where any journalist could face US charges for ""publishing truthful information about the United States"". She said she had visited Assange in the police cells where he thanked supporters and said: ""I told you so.""
After his arrest, the 47-year-old Australian national was initially taken to a central London police station before appearing in court. In court District Judge Michael Snow said Assange's behaviour was ""the behaviour of a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest"".

Why the US government wants to extradite Assange
Assange set up Wikileaks in 2006 with the aim of obtaining and publishing confidential documents and images. The organisation hit the headlines four years later when it released footage of US soldiers killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq.
Former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning was arrested in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos and diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy website.
She said she only did so to spark debates about foreign policy, but US officials said the leak put lives at risk. She was found guilty by a court martial in 2013 of charges including espionage. However, her jail sentence was later commuted.
Manning was recently jailed for refusing to testify before an investigation into Wikileaks' role in revealing the secret files.

What are the US charges against him?
The indictment against Assange, issued last year in the state of Virginia, alleges that he conspired in 2010 with Manning to access classified information on Department of Defense computers. He faces up to five years in jail.
Manning downloaded four databases from US departments and agencies between January and May 2010, the indictment says. This information, much of which was classified, was provided to Wikileaks.
The US Justice Department described it as ""one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States"".

How people reacted to the news?
Supporters of the WikiLeaks founderJulian Assangegathered outside the Ecuadorian embassy in central London after the organisation said its sources in Ecuador had revealed he could be removed from the building &ldquo;within hours to days&rdquo;. An advertising lorry displaying a billboard with photos of Assange and Chelsea Manning with US flag gags across their mouths and the words &ldquo;#Freespeech &hellip; except for war crimes&rdquo; was briefly parked directly in front of the embassy.
Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons: ""This goes to show that in the UK, no one is above the law.""
Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the arrest was the result of ""years of careful diplomacy"" and that it was ""not acceptable"" for someone to ""escape facing justice"".
But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed ""evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan"" and his extradition ""should be opposed by the British government"".
Press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders said that the UK should resist extradition, because it would ""set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistleblowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future"".
Actress Pamela Anderson, who has visited the embassy to support Assange, said the arrest was a ""vile injustice"".
And supporters of the journalist handed out leaflets urging people to write to their MPs to defend WikiLeaks and took turns to hold up a banner saying: &ldquo;The truth will set you free. Free Julian Assange.&rdquo;

647,"The United States have finally grounded Boeing 737 Max after investigators found similarities in the jets past crashes. Lion Air Flight 610 which was involved in a crash with no survivors killing 181 people. Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 which was involved in a crash again with no survivors killing 157 people that were on board.

The Federal Aviation Administration for some reason were reluctant in banning the aircraft even though many countries took safety precautions and banned the boeing 737 Max. Both American Airlines and Southwest Airlines released similar statements stating that they have &lsquo;full confidence in the aircraft&rsquo; 

American Airlines statement: &ldquo;At this time there are no facts on the cause of the accident other than news reports. We have full confidence in the aircraft and our crew members, who are the best and most experienced in the industry.&rdquo;

Southwest Airlines statement: &ldquo;We remain confident in the safety and airworthiness of our fleet of more than 750 Boeing aircraft.&rdquo;

The same crew members that American Airlines are talking about had complained late last year about problems controlling the Boeing 737 Max 8 during take-off. They reported difficulties similar to those that contributed to the fatal Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October.

Boeing created a new feature for the 737 Max an Anti-stall system, it basically prevents a plane from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. A report claimed that during the 29 October Lion Air flight, the plane's automatic anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, even when the plane was not stalling - possibly due to a faulty sensor. 

The Federal Aviation Administration said fresh evidence as well as newly refined satellite data prompted the decision to temporarily ban the jets after Sunday&rsquo;s tragic accident. The FAA has a team investigating the disaster at the Ethiopian Airlines crash site working with the National Transportation Safety Board. 

Dan Elwell acting administrator at the FAA said, &ldquo;It became clear to all parties that the track of the Ethiopian Airlines [flight] was very close and behaved very similarly to the Lion Air flight.&rdquo; He concluded his statement by saying that &ldquo;the evidence we found on the ground made it even more likely the flight path was very close to Lion Air's.&rdquo; 

Why weren&rsquo;t Boeing taking action though? Boeing needed to STOP JUSTIFYING and ground their 737 Max jets much sooner!! There&rsquo;s been 338 deaths in total and Boeing still claim to have confidence in their jets.

Boeing said that it &ldquo;continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max&rdquo;.
However, it added that after consultation with the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board it had decided to ground the flights &ldquo;out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraft's safety&rdquo;.

Dennis Muilenburg, president, chief executive and chairman of Boeing, said: &ldquo;We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Any plane currently in the air will go to its destination and thereafter be grounded until further notice, if they are the 373 Max.&rdquo;

&ldquo;The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern.&rdquo; - President Donald Trump 
"
648,"Sunday morning a normal day for most. Family and friends gathered at the airport waiting for their loved ones to arrive only to hear that the Ethiopian Airlines jet crashed shortly after take-off from Addis Ababa, The airline said 149 passengers from more than 30 countries and 8 crew members were on flight ET302 from the Ethiopian capital to Nairobi in Kenya. The crash happened at 08:44 local time, only six minutes after Boeing 737 Max-8 took off. An eyewitness at the scene told the BBC that there was an intense fire as the aircraft hit the ground. Looking at the images from the crash site, there&rsquo;s barely anything in sight apart from a huge hole from the point on impact.
The cause of the disaster is not yet clear. However, the pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to Addis Ababa. The pilot was named as Senior Captain Yared Getachew who had a ""commendable performance"" with more than 8,000 hours in the air, the airline said.
""We cannot also attribute the cause to anything because we will have to comply with the international regulation to wait for the investigation,"" Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam told reporters at Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa.
Such a tragedy losing everyone on board yesterday and so many people around the world sent out heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of the victims.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed tweeted:
The Office of the PM, on behalf of the Government and people of Ethiopia, would like to express it&rsquo;s deepest condolences to the families of those that have lost their loved ones on Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 on regular scheduled flight to Nairobi, Kenya this morning.

KQ CEO Sebastian Mikosz tweeted:
On behalf of @KenyaAirways, we would like to send a message of condolences to all the families of those that have lost their loved ones on flight ET302. To our friends in @flyethiopian: you can count on our full support in this very difficult moment.
Executive Director for The World Food Programme, David Beasley tweeted:
The WFP family mourns today -- @WFP staff were among those aboard the Ethiopian Airlines flight. We will do all that is humanly possible to help the families at this painful time. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers.
On the front page of the WFP website reads:
The World Food Programme family has suffered a profound loss. Those who died were devoted to making the world a better place and they will be missed terribly.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May tweeted:
I was deeply saddened to hear of the devastating loss of life following the plane crash in Ethiopia. At this very difficult time my thoughts are with the families and friends of the British citizens on board and all those affected by this tragic incident.
The UN secretary-general Ant&oacute;nio Guterres tweeted:
Deeply saddened by the news this morning of the plane crash in Ethiopia, claiming the lives of all on board. My heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all the victims &mdash; including our own @UN staff &mdash; who perished in this tragedy.
Union Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan tweeted:
My condolences to the families of four Indian nationals who have died in an unfortunate crash of Ethiopian Airlines.Sadly,a UNDP consultant attached to my ministry @moefcc Ms Shikha Garg,also died in the crash. My prayers for the departed souls. @IndiaInEthiopia @SushmaSwaraj
Mahboub Maalim, executive secretary of the East African bloc IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development), made a statement saying, ""I cannot seem to find words comforting enough to the families and friends of those who might have lost their lives in this tragedy."" 
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed wrapped up Sunday&rsquo;s tragedy 10th March 2019 by declaring Monday 11th March 2019 as a day of national mourning for all the victims of the crash.
He said, in a statement, that the crash will be investigated and ""communicated promptly"".
It is unfortunately the second time in less than six months that one of the planes has crashed within minutes of takeoff, after a new Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight went down over the Java Sea last October, killing 189 people.With both crashes being under investigation, the incidents have raised caution among some aviation authorities and airlines. According to the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) there are approximately 350 Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft in operation worldwide, being flown by 54 operators. 
As a precaution many airlines and countries have grounded Boeing 737 Max 8 namely, Ethiopian Airlines, China Airlines, China Eastern, China Southern, Aeromexico, Aerol&iacute;neas Argentinas, Comair Airways, Eastar Jet, The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced Tuesday it was ""temporarily suspending operation of all variants of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft into and out of Singapore in light of two fatal accidents involving Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in less than five months."" and so did Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA).
Surprisingly, American airlines, Southwest Airlines, Norwegian Airlines, Icelandair, Fiji Airways, Brazilian airline GOL Linhas A&eacute;reas, Flydubai and Canadian airline WestJet said that they have no plans on grounding the jet. 
The US carrier has 24 737 MAX 8 aircraft in its fleet and says it has no plans to ground them at the moment.
In a statement, American Airlines expressed its condolences to the families of those killed, and said it would continue to monitor the investigation into the crash.
""At this time there are no facts on the cause of the accident other than news reports,"" read the statement. ""We have full confidence in the aircraft and our crew members, who are the best and most experienced in the industry."""

651,"British rapper J Hus surprised the crowd at London&rsquo;s O2 Arena on April 5th when he joined Drake onstage for his first public appearance since being released from jail. Drake announced the rapper&rsquo;s return by saying, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re about to celebrate one of our brothers tonight, I&rsquo;m ready if you&rsquo;re ready&rdquo; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go&rdquo; A giant &ldquo;Welcome Home&rdquo; message lit up across the stage floor as J Hus made his way on stage.The rapper formally known as Momodou Jallow was caught with a weapon near the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, on 21st June. Police stopped him and his girlfriend after smelling cannabis. When asked if he was carrying anything he shouldn&rsquo;t have been, he said he had a 10cm folding knife. He explained: &ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s Westfield.&rdquo; Judge Sheila Canavan said she would be &ldquo;failing in my duty&rdquo; if she did not jail him. She recognised his &ldquo;considerable talent&rdquo; but said that he had &ldquo;failed to leave his past behind him&rdquo;.He initially pled not guilty to the charge, but later changed his plea, reportedly apologizing to the judge in a letter stating that he was sorry and that he &ldquo;fully accepted his actions were careless&rdquo;. Even though this is the fourth time the rapper has been caught with a knife and previously receiving an asbo. Fans have been eager for his release and took to Twitter expressing their excitement. A fan tweeted &ldquo;Best part of the concert... Jhus is home ❤️&rdquo; and another &ldquo;JHUS is f***ing homeeeee !! from prison to performing on stage with drake tonight .. jheeze 🔥&rdquo;Let&rsquo;s hope the rapper can leave his past behind him, focus on his music and make better decisions this year.

In the Netflix special According to a press release Hart &ldquo;touches upon his friends, family, travel &hellip; and a year filled with Irresponsible behavior.&rdquo;
The debut of the new special follows a chaotic few months for the comedian, in which he was hired to host the Oscars, then stepped down following a controversy over homophobic tweets and jokes made at his comedy shows. Even though it was his goal to host the Oscars for a long time Hart said he did not want to be a distraction and that he was &ldquo;sorry he had hurt people.&rdquo; &ldquo;My goal is to bring people together not tear us apart.&rdquo; A Netflix special should be able to do just that!!"
654,"So at the beginning of the year Kanye West filed a lawsuit against his publisher, EMI Publishing, in an attempt to get out of his contract on the basis that he has fulfilled all his obligations.
The lawsuit claims that Kanye isn&rsquo;t allowed to retire from making music. Thanks to The Hollywood reporter for obtaining a copy of the lawsuit we can have a look at Kanye's EMI contract;
""You (Mr. West) hereby represent and warrant that to [EMI] that You will, throughout the Term as extended by this Modification, remain actively involved in writing, recording and producing Compositions and Major Label Albums, as Your principle occupation,"" reads a portion of Kanye's EMI contract quoted for his lawsuit complaint. ""At no time during the Term will you seek to retire as a songwriter, recording artist or producer or take any extended hiatus during which you are not actively pursuing Your musical career in the same basic manner as You have pursued such career to date. (The preceding representation shall not be deemed to prevent You from taking a vacation of limited duration.)""
So kanye&rsquo;s attorneys filed a lawsuit stating that the rappers EMI contract contains a clause which is in violation of the California labor code section 2855, the De Havilland Law, which states that personal service contracts can go for no more than seven years and since he signed this deal in 2003, Kanye should be free from the contract right ? Wrong. Well not really but a judge has to determine whether this is a case about his employment in which his argument would be valid or if it&rsquo;s based on his intellectual property.Kanye&rsquo;s lawsuit is different than most cases of this nature and so could be made into a copyright case which would move it from state court to federal court.
 At this point all Kanye wants is to get out of the deal and be free. He also said that EMI owes him money and is seeking a declaration of ownership of all the works he&rsquo;s done after 2010. In his complaint kanye emphasizes that,""It makes no difference under section 2855 whether the contract is otherwise fair, or whether the employer has fulfilled its end of the bargain, It matters only whether the services began more than seven years ago. There can be no dispute that this happened here. The seven year period ended under this contract on October 1, 2010."" If kanye is successful in his suit it would mean that he would regain the rights to all of his music created after October 2010.
According to DjBooth, this is a huge case that could significantly alter how music publishers and record companies treat their songwriters and performing artists because it is an existential threat to music publishers (and record companies)."
655,"Evil has struck humanity yet again. The series of deadly terror attacks in New Zealand has left us speechless. Most of us didn&rsquo;t know New Zealand&rsquo;s prime minister before the Christchurch attack, we all came to find out who this amazing person is.
Her sincere and genuine response has shown us that there are leaders who possess and actually deserve to be in the spotlight leading and being the voice of a nation. 
She is a true leader, she brought her people and the world together as we all grieved for the souls lost. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern provided a shoulder to cry on, she showed a courageous face against hatred, offered those in distress genuine aid and comfort. All in all she stood by them.
She told the Muslim community who lost loved ones on such a tragic day that the government will take care of all funeral expenses, regardless of citizenship/visa status; she promised financial aid. Prime Minister Ardern embraced the victims 'as ours' even if they weren&rsquo;t citizens, she disavowed and disconnected from the perpetrator even if he is from the same race and religion.
She hasn&rsquo;t shied away from using strong language and immediately describing this as a terrorist and barbaric act;
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern gave an emotional speech at her first address to Parliament since the terror attack, praising the &lsquo;extraordinary courage&rsquo; demonstrated by mosque worshipers and police during one of the country's &lsquo;darkest days.&rsquo;
&ldquo;There have rightly been questions around how this could have happened here. In a place that prides itself on being open, peaceful, diverse. And there is anger that it has happened here,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;He sought many things from his act of terror, but one was notoriety. And that is why you will never hear me mention his name,&rdquo; said Arden.
&ldquo;Speak the names of those who were lost, rather than name of the man who took them. He may have sought notoriety, but we in New Zealand will give him nothing. Not even his name.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We have seen in countries that know the horrors of terrorism more than us, there is a pattern of increased tension and actions over the weeks that follow that means we do need to ensure that vigilance is maintained,&rdquo; she concluded.
Jacinda Ardern has forever won my respect, and the respect of millions of people around the globe, Muslim and non Muslim. Respect to all the New Zealanders and Australians people showing the remorse and solidarity to the victims, students gathered to pay tribute to the victims of the mosque shootings by performing haka dances, a ceremonial tradition from the indigenous Māori people, performed as a mark of respect and honor.
May God send peace and tranquility upon the people of New zealand and recompense them with better. May He protect them, fill them with patience and grant the dead the reward of martyrs.

656,"Anthony Joshua, 29, was due to defend his IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles against undefeated American Big Baby Miller, who has never fought for a world title. However, he&rsquo;s been denied a licence to fight the Briton by the New York State Athletic Commission following an adverse finding from a drugs test in March. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Joshua&rsquo;s promoter, Eddie Hearn said on Twitter of the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) test: &ldquo;We have been informed by VADA that there has been an adverse finding in Jarrell Miller's sample collected on March 20, 2019.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We are working with all relevant parties and will update with more details soon.&rdquo;
Miller's camp have now requested a B sample to be tested and if that sample comes back negative then Miller can make another application for a licence.
Good news for Aj&rsquo;s fans as he&rsquo;s still eager to make his debut in America. The heavyweight champion has pledged that his American debut will go ahead as planned at Madison Square Garden in six weeks&rsquo; time even though he might not be going against his original opponent who would of earned $6&thinsp;million (&pound;4.6&thinsp;million) for the fight.
Hearn, told Telegraph Sport: &ldquo;We are talking to other potential opponents. The first person I called when I learnt the news was Anthony, and he said &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fight anybody. The event goes on. Just get me an opponent&rsquo;.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We had a dozen calls from fighters wanting an opportunity and we will go through the serious ones. Anyone in the top 15 in the world is acceptable, but the higher ranked, the bigger the name, the better.&rdquo;
&ldquo;In an ideal world, we would prefer it to be an American opponent, but there are 17,000 tickets sold and 10,000 Brits are flying over. How many of those were coming to watch Miller?&rdquo;
Matchroom chief executive Frank Smith told BBC Sport: &ldquo;Our plan right now is that we carry on with Madison Square Garden on 1 June and we will announce more details soon.&rdquo;"

Little is known, but a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said Hussle was shot by a young man who opened fire at close range and then ran to a waiting getaway car. Based on initial information, the shooting was likely planned and gang-related, the source said.
The rapper owned several businesses on the block where he was shot, said 54-year-old Hyde Park resident Glenn Taylor, including a burger restaurant, a barbershop and a fish market. He was known to give jobs to residents who were struggling to get by, some of them homeless. He once gave a pair of shoes to every student at 59th Street Elementary School. He also donated money to renovate the school&rsquo;s playground and basketball courts.Taylor, whose daughter was a childhood friend of Hussle&rsquo;s, said he was stunned.
&ldquo;He did so much for our neighborhood,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here today. This has to stop.&rdquo;
Deepest prayers to Nipsey&rsquo;s family, friends and fans during this difficult time."

659,"Tropical Cyclone Idai is one of the worst tropical cyclones on record to affect Africa and the Southern Hemisphere. The long-lived storm which began on March 4th - March 21st caused catastrophic damage in multiple nations, taking the lives of 1000s, UNICEF estimates that 1,000,000 children are affected and Red Cross admits that relief efforts so far are nowhere near the scale and magnitude of the problem. 
Idai first hit Mozambique on 4 March as a tropical depression with torrential rain that also affected southern Malawi. It then changed course, moving back over the sea where the storm strengthened to a cyclone with the equivalent force of a category 3 hurricane. When Idai made landfall for the second time on 14 March it brought winds of up to 115 mph/185 kph and more than 150mm of rain in 24 hours to the city of Beira and nearby Buzi district. It then swept inland and on to Zimbabwe.
Entire villages have been destroyed in Mozambique and Zimbabwe;

All numbers for deaths are still preliminary, said Mozambique&rsquo;s environment minister, Celso Correia. As flood waters recede and more bodies are discovered, the final death toll in Mozambique alone could be above the early estimate of 1,000 made by the country&rsquo;s president a few days after the cyclone hit, said aid workers.
More than 120,000 people are now in camps for more than a week after Cyclone Idai hit, said Correia, the Mozambican government&rsquo;s emergency coordinator. As efforts to rescue people trapped by the floods wind down, aid workers across the region are bracing for the spread of disease, including cholera and malaria.

Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said the humanitarian situation was gradually improving. &ldquo;Every day the water recedes we reach more people. Every day the roads open we have better access and we can deliver at more volume and that is the important thing here.&rdquo;
He said two large field hospitals and water purification systems were on their way, joining a wide-ranging effort that includes drones to scout out areas in need across the landscape of central Mozambique.
The scale of the devastation was &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo;, he said, not only because of the cyclone and flooding but because the land had already been saturated by earlier rains.
A week after the onset of Cyclone Idai, as the waters have receded in some places, some of those trapped in villages in the midst of the flood waters have at last managed to get out. Survivors tell similar stories of being trapped, &ldquo;It was very scary, we were running in all directions, the water was full of snakes,&rdquo; recalls 39-year-old Otelea Jose. Even though they&rsquo;ve been rescued they don&rsquo;t feel like that&rsquo;s the case. Many of them are angry at the slowness of the rescue effort.
They say that they&rsquo;ve heard the rescue helicopters fly over and seen the boat rescue teams that have been dispatched, but what they need most, the simple necessities of life &ndash; food, clothes and shelter has yet to arrive, despite the mounting international rescue effort centred on Beira.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have anything,&rdquo; says Josef Marius Jafate, a 29-year-old farmer who, like many of those in this impromptu roadside camp, is surviving solely on the river fish he can catch.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have rice, or flour or any clothes. We need shelter. When is the help going to come?&rdquo; he says.
Describing the scale of the disaster, Gerry Bourke of the World Food Programme tells the Guardian that the growing international rescue effort still does not know how many people remain trapped in the flood waters. 
Jamie LeSueur of the Red Cross made a statement, &ldquo;We could see from our first aerial surveys that Beira had been badly hit,&rdquo; &ldquo;What we weren&rsquo;t able to predict was the scale of the flooding that would follow.&rdquo;
Even now officials admit they have yet to get a full picture of the scale of the disaster. They merely describe it as &ldquo;overwhelming&rdquo;.

Going crazy all because individuals are sentenced to life in prison due to shoplifting, being in possession of a crack pipe, facilitating a $10 sale of marijuana or attempting to cash a stolen check. Being sentenced to life without parole for non-violent crimes such as stealing a jacket worth $159. It sounds unimaginable doesn&rsquo;t it ? But this is Timothy Jackson&rsquo;s reality, an African American man who was convicted under Louisiana's &lsquo;three strike law&rsquo;, one that imposes harsher sentences for repeat offenders no matter what the crime. So that meant being locked up with the keys thrown away!
Another life taken and thrown. Ronald Washington, 48, serving life without parole in Angola, in his case for shoplifting two Michael Jordan jerseys from a Foot Action sportswear store in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 2004. Explains how he felt after learning about his fate, &ldquo;It's a very lonely world, seems that nobody cares. You're never ever returning back into society. And whatever you had or established, it&rsquo;s now useless, because you're being buried alive at slow pace.&rdquo;Moving on to a case with a totally different outcome, the one of Nataliia Karia. A Minneapolis day care owner, who attempted to kill a toddler in her home by hanging him from a noose, running over two men with her minivan before attempting suicide. Karia, was only sentenced to 10 years of probation. WHAT ??
More than 3,200 people in the U.S are facing life sentences for non-violent crimes. Louisiana, where both Washington and Jackson are held, is one of nine states where prisoners are serving life without parole sentences for non-violent offences other states with high numbers are Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Oklahoma and South Carolina.

Over the years it&rsquo;s common to hear about celebrities going through addiction and it&rsquo;s truly sad how we lose incredible talent because of it. Let&rsquo;s unveil the glamour behind Hollywood and understand how normal people like you and I can change when we&rsquo;re exposed to the entertainment industry and let&rsquo;s also discuss why drug abuse is so common.
Drinking, snorting cocaine, smoking weed, popping mollies and sipping codeine is seen and heard on Tv, in song lyrics and all over social media. People take pride in doing drugs it&rsquo;s not even seen as shameful anymore. If you&rsquo;re popping molly and taking percocet you&rsquo;re seen as cool and if you release a song about it you&rsquo;re making money and you&rsquo;re even cooler.
Celebrities and social influencers who are rich and successful, party with copious amounts of alcohol and other illicit substances. Showing this off online normalises the concept. It can really take a toll on younger generations who are easily influenced and might be led to believe that they can do it because their &lsquo;idol&rsquo; is doing it too. They might also develop the perception that drugs and alcohol aren&rsquo;t derailing the lives of celebrities or social influencers, so it won&rsquo;t adversely affect their own.
It&rsquo;s not always just about partying though there&rsquo;s so much that goes on behind the scenes. The entertainment industry is super fast pace and if you can&rsquo;t hack it you&rsquo;re out. You can be replaced so fast because there&rsquo;s always a girl/guy next door that can take your place. This fast paced lifestyle is what can throw people over the edge. Keeping up with interviews, press conferences, shows and events, one can end up depending on drugs and alcohol to stay up, party, entertain, talk, sing, perform and lastly pills to even sleep. The industry needs to realize you can only push people so far before they break. Making money isn&rsquo;t the problem, the problem is no room for self-care. We should encourage people that realise they need help to go and get it rather than saying let&rsquo;s continue you will be fine.


Some of the worst breakdowns in the entertainment industry
Britney Spears

Britney shaved her head on Feb. 16, 2007, and four days later, she checked into rehab for the second time within one week, though it was never revealed what substances she was allegedly using at the time. Days later, she attacked a paparazzo's car with an umbrella. In January 2008, Spears barricaded herself in the bathroom of her Los Angeles home with her son, Jayden. Police came to the scene and had her taken to a hospital via ambulance and placed on a psychiatric hold. 
Radar Online reports that in a 2012 court hearing, Spears' former ""manager"" and hanger-on, Osama ""Sam"" Lutfi, claimed the singer was addicted to drugs. Lutfi's attorney, Joseph Schleimer, told the court, ""Britney Spears was addicted to speed, methamphetamine was her drug of choice."" He added that Lutfi brought drug-sniffing dogs to Spears' home in an attempt to ensure she was clean, noting, ""The dogs found hot spots of drug residue in the carpet and her children crawled on the carpets."" The attorney said an overdose on 30 pills led to Spears' psychiatric hold in 2008.

Lindsey Lohan

Lindsay Lohan's convoluted path through the legal system, which began with a drunken driving arrest in 2007. She struggled with drugs and alcohol that sent her to several rehab facilities. In 2012 a judge advised the star by saying, ""I know it's hard when people are following you all over the place, but that's the life you chose, live your life in a more mature way, stop the nightclubbing and focus on your work.""

Orlando Brown

The former Disney Channel star is faced drug charges last year. He was booked on one charge of felony narcotics possession later discovered to be meth, as well as misdemeanor charges of drug paraphernalia, resisting arrest and obstructing a public officer. At the time he also had an active warrant for domestic battery. 


Some of the talent the world has lost to drugs
Prince 
In the months leading up to Prince&rsquo;s death, his friends and family were reportedly becoming increasingly concerned with Prince&rsquo;s prescription drug use. On a flight home from an Atlanta concert, the Academy Award-winning singer overdosed on Percocet that he was taking for hip problems. During the following days, Prince&rsquo;s associates were in contact with a California addiction specialist to get the singer into a rehab facility. But before they could get him into rehab, Prince was found dead from an apparent drug overdose which a toxicology report revealed was fentanyl, an extremely potent opioid.
Whitney Houston
Whitney Houston was open about her history of drug use in interviews with Diane Sawyer in 2002 and Oprah Winfrey in 2009. She had attended outpatient rehab for alcohol and drug addiction in 2011. However, died of an overdose the following year with her body being discovered in the bathroom of the Beverly Hilton Hotel submerged in a bathtub. An autopsy reported that she died from drowning, atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use.
Amy Winehouse
Despite rejecting initial intervention attempts, Winehouse attended rehab in the years before her death. However, she was never able to maintain sobriety or long-term recovery. After being congratulated for winning five Grammys, Winehouse reportedly told her friend: &ldquo;Jules, this is so boring without drugs.&rdquo; The singer died in 2011 after an alcohol overdose.
Mac Miller 
Rapper Mac Miller&rsquo;s death was the result of an accidental overdose, according to a toxicology report released by the L.A. County Coroners Office. The combination of drugs found in Miller&rsquo;s system is described as &lsquo;recreational&rsquo;, the drugs found in his system which caused his death were Fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol.
People have high expectations for celebrities and social influencers, and the media and public can be incredibly damning when they make small mistakes. This pressure can lead to intense anxiety or depression and in some cases suicide. Drug abuse and addiction has affected some of the most amazing entertainers in the world and it&rsquo;s taken the lives of icons year after year. However, some have overcome addiction and inspired others by proving that recovery is possible. Demi Lovato advice is, &ldquo;If you feel like you don&rsquo;t have anybody, look within yourself and try to find that resilience that will ultimately get you through whatever it is you&rsquo;re going through. Every single person on this planet is worth life.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Once addiction is there, the trappings of celebrity can cause addiction to blossom,&rdquo; Dr. Drew Pinsky said in 2010. &ldquo;Famous addicts make all the money they need to feed their addiction. They have enablers who can get them the drugs and assistants who are making too much money off them and don&rsquo;t want to step in. So the addiction grows.&rdquo;

662,"After months of protests in Sudan, former President Omar al-Bashir has been moved to Kobar maximum security prison, days after he was deposed in a military coup.
Following the dramatic end to Bashir&rsquo;s rule of three decades last week, he was moved late Tuesday &ldquo;to Kober prison in Khartoum&rdquo;, the source said without revealing his name for security reasons. Reports say the ex-leader who was accused of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan's western Darfur region and has until now been detained at the presidential residence under heavy guard and he is reportedly being held in solitary confinement and is surrounded by tight security.
Witnesses near the prison in north Khartoum said there was a heavy deployment of soldiers and members of a paramilitary group outside. The 75-year-old&rsquo;s whereabouts have been unknown since a military takeover on Thursday, when the country&rsquo;s new rulers said he was being held &ldquo;in a secure place&rdquo;. 
The detention of Bashir has failed to pacify protesters, who launched anti-government demonstrations in December and have for days been camped out in front of Khartoum&rsquo;s army headquarters determined to complete their revolution seeking civilian rule. 
Roads leading to a sit-in outside the army headquarters were filled with demonstrators as people converged on the site chanting &ldquo;power to civilians, power to civilians&rdquo; and &ldquo;freedom, peace, justice&rdquo;.
 &ldquo;We faced tear gas, many of us were jailed. We have been shot and many have died. All this because we said what we wanted to,&rdquo; protester Fadia Khalaf told AFP.
Officials say at least 65 people have been killed in protest-related violence since December with some of those killed immortalised in a Khartoum mural.
On taking power on Thursday the army said a military council would run the country for two years, sparking an immediate backlash from protest leaders who have issued a series of demands.
Numbers had dwindled following Bashir&rsquo;s departure, but protesters returned in force to keep up pressure for a civilian government to replace the military council now in charge.
&ldquo;Now we fear that our revolution could be stolen, which is why we are keeping our ground here. We are staying here until our demands are met,&rdquo; said Khalaf.
&ldquo;We are sending a message that we are not leaving this area until we achieve our goal,&rdquo; said protester Ahmed.
&ldquo;The idea is to keep the fire burning.&rdquo;
The Sudanese Professionals' Association (SPA), which has spearheaded the protests, urged supporters to stop efforts to disperse them, calling on demonstrators to ""protect your revolution and your accomplishments"".An SPA spokesman told the BBC that the group ""completely rejected"" the transitional military council leading the country, and said protesters seek the dismantling of state intelligence agencies and the ""full dissolution of the deep state"".
Military council spokesman Maj Gen Shams Ad-din Shanto announced a set of new measures on Sunday, including the end of censorship and new heads of the security forces.
The council has arrested former government members, he said, and will put in place whatever civilian government and whichever prime minister opposition groups agree. But while the council promised not to remove protesters from their sit-in, the major also called on them to stop unauthorised roadblocks and ""let normal life resume"". 
""Taking up arms will not be tolerated,"" he added.
Former defence minister General Awad Ibn Ouf stepped down as council chief, sparking jubilation on the streets of Khartoum. His successor General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan oversaw weekend talks with political parties, which failed to make headway.
Sudan&rsquo;s foreign minister has said Burhan is &ldquo;committed to having a complete civilian government&rdquo; and has called on other nations to back the council.
The military rulers dispatched an envoy to the African Union&rsquo;s headquarters in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, but the regional bloc threatened to suspend Sudan over the coup.
The 55-member union has given the military council just 15 days to hand over to civilian rule, while the United Nations has appointed a new envoy to work with the AU on mediating an end to the crisis.
International Crisis Group analyst Alan Boswell said the revolution was &ldquo;still unfinished&rdquo;.
&ldquo;The security cabal which still has power in Sudan is clearly resisting demands that would force it to cede its own power,&rdquo; he said.
The protesters won the resignation of feared intelligence chief Saleh Ghosh, who oversaw a crackdown on protesters that left dozens dead, hundreds wounded and thousands jailed.
But as pressure grows from world powers and the Sudanese street, all eyes are on the military council&rsquo;s next move.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we are anywhere close to the end of the road yet,&rdquo; Boswell said.
&ldquo;We are hitting pretty dangerous waters.&rdquo;
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have thrown their support behind the military, whose troops are set to remain in an alliance led by the Gulf powerhouses in Yemen.
Western powers which previously called on Bashir to heed protesters&rsquo; demands have continued to back the demonstrators, pushing for a civilian administration in talks with military rulers.
The United States on Thursday welcomed military orders to free political prisoners and end a curfew, but urged more moves to transition to democracy."
663,"At least 290 people have been killed in several coordinated bomb attacks on churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter, the coordinated attacks took place on Sunday morning. Six suicide bombers took part in the devastating attacks targeting Christians and foreigners. 

Several Christian communities spread across the island nation were targeted in the attack: Suicide bombers detonated one set of bombs at churches in the cities of Colombo and Negombo on the western coast, home to many Sinhalese-speaking Catholics. Another was detonated in a Protestant church 200 miles away in Batticaloa, a city in the Tamilmajority eastern side of the island. According to media reports, there were eight blasts in total carried out in not only churches but also luxury hotels in the capital Colombo. Killing close to 300 people and wounding at least 500 making it the worst attack since the civil war that ended 10 years ago.

Images of splintered pews and blood stained floors played across local television screens on Sunday as the enormity of the attacks, launched on the holiest day of the Christian calendar, became clear.

Though it wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear who was behind the eight explosions, Manisha Gunasekera, high commissioner of Sri Lanka to the UK, said the blasts are &ldquo;certainly acts of terror.&rdquo;
The government on Monday blamed a little-known radical Islamist group for the devastating Easter Sunday suicide bombings. Sri Lanka&rsquo;s government says the attacks were carried out by National Thowheeth Jamaath, a group that promotes a terrorist ideology in South Asia with a reputation for vandalizing Buddhist statues but little history of carrying out terrorist attacks. Which has the officials believing the group had received help from an international terrorist organization. 
Most of the victims who died and/or were injured were Sri Lankan. At least 39 tourists were killed, the country&rsquo;s tourism minister said on Monday. Eight victims were British citizens, two of whom held dual US-UK nationality; as well as three Indians, two Australians, two Chinese cousins, one person from the Netherlands, two Turkish citizens and one Portuguese national.
Sri Lanka&rsquo;s security forces were warned at least 14 days before the bombings that the militant group was planning attacks against churches, but apparently took no action against it, indicating a catastrophic intelligence failure. However, top government officials say the warning never reached them. Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne on Monday blamed President Maithripala Sirisena's government for failing to act on intelligence that was brought to light. 
Speaking at a press conference in the capital Colombo, Senaratne said the failure to act against National Thowheeth Jama'ath, a hardline Muslim organisation in Sri Lanka, had devastated the entire country.
""Unfortunately, despite all these revelations by the intelligence units, we could not avert these attacks,"" Senaratne, also the cabinet spokesman, said.
Sri Lanka is a predominantly Buddhist nation, but it&rsquo;s also home to significant Hindu, Muslim and Christian communities. A popular destination for tourists, the country has been largely peaceful since the end of its 26-year civil war. While there has been intermittent conflict between religious groups &mdash; including threats to Christians &mdash; nothing remotely like Sunday&rsquo;s attacks had occurred there. In the aftermath of the 8 explosions authorities have declared a state of emergency, and are conducting search and rescue operations. 
Even after police arrested 24 people in connection with the attacks Sri Lankan officials took a series of extraordinary steps in an effort to keep control of their shaken country, aiming to prevent further extremist attacks and retaliatory violence. Colombo has declared an indefinite national curfew and blocked social media networks such as Facebook and WhatsApp in order to prevent the spread of rumors that might spark intercommunal violence, as happened in March 2018 when Buddhist mobs attacked Muslim mosques, businesses, and homes.
The Sri Lanka's government has declared Tuesday, April 23 a day of national mourning, thePresident's Media Division announced.

664,"Dr. Thabat Al-Khatib works as a researcher in Applied Neuroscience at the University of Aberdeen in the Faculty of Medicine, she graduated high school from Arab American school in Jenin 2009 with a rate of 98%. Then graduated from Biology and Biotechnology program at the Faculty of Sciences and Arts from Arab American University in 2012 with a rate of 3.95 first in her specialization and third place among the university, after that she directly joined a Masters program in Life Sciences at Al-Najah University, her thesis was about &ldquo;Cancer&rdquo;, she graduated in 2014 with a rate of 4 and was the first among her university. She continued to seek knowledge aiming higher for a Ph.D, in her pursuit of a Ph.D she submitted applications to a number of European universities; the University of Aberdeen, the fifth oldest university in Britain, approved her application and provided her with a scholarship to follow her passion at the Faculty of Medicine. In 2018, in just three years, she earned her Ph.D. and went on to work as a postdoctoral researcher at Aberdeen University&rsquo;s Neuroscience department.

&ldquo;Although I wished to become a doctor, when I grew up I decided to change my style of study to become a researcher studying the brain, nerves and diseases that could infect them in the laboratory, as well as a lecturer in medical schools to convey to new generations of doctors new knowledge and the latest science, effort,&rdquo; said Thabat Khatib.

The young Dr. did just that, she found a passion in the neuroscience field and looked to find clinical cures and drugs to the diseases of the nervous system, especially Alzheimer&rsquo;s, a type of dementia that affects 50 million people worldwide. Dr. Khatib had an idea of developing a drug with a new formulation that would combat dementia in the elderly. Her dream of finding a cure to one of the most common, incurable diseases in the world, had just begun.

The Palestinian scientist was the first neurological researcher to patent the development of brand new pharmaceutical combinations that affect the neurons and improve their performance in many ways. These combinations, she says, may be a good remedy to various neurological diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease.

&ldquo;I began to discover these combinations by noting that the elderly and people with Alzheimer's disease are experiencing a shortage in a chemical called &ldquo;retinoic acid&rdquo; and dysfunction in its work and production in the body,&rdquo; Khatib told WAFA. 

A shortage of the retinoic acid causes a malfunction in the efficiency of the nervous system&rsquo;s neurons. People with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease lack the chemical because their bodies cannot produce it on its own and must acquire it from Vitamin A.
Khatib&rsquo;s idea was to synthetically-manufacture a more effective, more powerful form of retinoic acid in the form of a drug. Her work secured more than EUR 400,000 in funding, and she received the green light to begin drug preparations at the laboratory, as well as two patents for the idea.

Therefore, she explains to WAFA, &ldquo;I was able to develop similar, more powerful and more effective pharmaceutical combinations similar to retinoic acid. These combinations are still under examination in the laboratory to see how long their effects are.&rdquo;

&ldquo;If everything goes as expected without any difficulties, the pharmaceutical combinations will be manufactured and distributed to the market in the form of medications. The process is expected to last for several years,&rdquo; she continued.

Khatib stated that she hopes that clinical human trials would commence soon. &ldquo;If everything goes smoothly, it will be the first drug of its kind in the world in terms of formulation and function and will benefit patients on a larger scale.&rdquo; 

The incredible and inspirational scientist hopes that one day she can return to her homeland to teach and inspire younger girls in Palestine and the Arab world to pursue their dreams no matter the obstacles they face.

When asked to advise students, she said: &ldquo;You should believe in yourselves and in your abilities and not give up regardless of the challenges you may face. With hard work and faith, you can achieve your dreams and do what is impossible.&rdquo;

.. and that&rsquo;s exactly what the young Palestinian scientist has done."
665,"Ten days ago, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, hiked the price of petrol by 250 per cent, making it the most expensive in the world. There had been a fuel shortage for months and this move was supposed to ease the situation but unfortunately that was a far cry from reality. President Mnangagwa then jetted off to Russia and Kazakhstan, a warm-up tour for his gig at Davos. He left his deputy, Constantino Chiwenga to handle the crisis that unfolded. 

During the protests several people were killed and hundreds more were arrested as demonstrators took to the streets in the cities of Harare and Bulawayo. The protests developed into the blocking of roads, looting of shops and arson. 

This was when the main labour body, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), accused the government of a lack of empathy for the poor, AFP news agency reports.

""People are protesting now that things are hurting. People are suffering,"" a protester told the BBC's Shingai Nyoka in Harare. He added that the government does not seem to have solutions to their problems and called on it to step down.

""We want Mnangagwa to know our displeasure in his failure,"" an angry protester told AFP. ""[Former President] Mugabe was evil but he listened,"" he added.
Amid all this commotion the government imposed a nationwide internet shutdown. Then, under cover of a government-imposed internet blackout, the security forces were unleashed by the vice-president unleashing havoc and terror amongst all zimbabweans in sight. Soldiers went house-to-house, smashing windows, beating residents at random and stomping on their cellphones. The soldiers killed at least 12 people and wounded another 80 or so. More than 242 people were treated for bite wounds from patrol dogs. Police arrested more than 1,000, including some ten opposition MPs. And, if that wasn&rsquo;t enough soldiers conducted acts of ritual humiliation.

Harare lawyer Kudzayi Kadzere believes the state is conspiring - to a degree rarely seen even under President Mugabe's rule - to silence dissent.
""We have seen a pattern of co-ordinated action between the army, the police, the prosecution and the courts,"" Mr Kadzere said.
""It is to suppress the voice of the people who want to express their anger at the deteriorating conditions in the country.""

Messages surfaced from scared citizens concluding that the internet was shut down to prevent the world from helping them. When the internet blackout was lifted the reality of what was happening was unimaginable. Citizens dead, opposition and union leaders arrested, populations terrorised by its own government.

The coalition called on regional bodies, particularly the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (AU) to support and guarantee an internal and inclusive stakeholders&rsquo; dialogue. 
&ldquo;The SADC and the AU must promote and support efforts at arresting the economic downturn in Zimbabwe based on a clear reform roadmap and encourage Zimbabwe to adopt and implement pro-poor and inclusive economic policies. 
""The government of Zimbabwe must also eliminate high-level corruption by ending parochial elite economic accumulation. Therefore, efforts at economic transformation, stabilisation and growth should be aimed at achieving inclusive sustainable economic growth and development.&rdquo;
On Tuesday, the Zimbabwe Communist Party (ZCP) said it was ready to participate in engagements aimed at rebuilding the nation, following a call by Mnangagwa for a ""national dialogue&rdquo;, but called on the government to first release all detained activists. 

Mnangagwa this week promised to investigate the conduct of security forces that terrorised citizens amid protests sparked by a massive fuel price increase two weeks ago. He said the violence by the security forces was &ldquo;unacceptable and a betrayal of the new Zimbabwe&rdquo;. &ldquo;Misconduct will be investigated. If required, heads will roll,&rdquo; Mnangagwa said on Twitter.

According to Paul Siwela Painful decisions must be taken with calculated outcomes and pain must be felt across the board and more to those who have caused the country to be on its knees. Some of the decisions he suggested were for one, all former leaders under Robert Mugabe to be arrested and their assets be forfeited to the state and funds deposited outside the country be repatriated, all those implicated in corruption in government, parastatals, state owned companies, local government and everywhere else to be put on trial and lastly those who trivialise Matebele Genocide and crimes against humanity to be arrested and locked up.

He also added that if the above can not be adopted then there is no future in Zimbabwe even if the parties or presidents in power were changed 12 times a year, the outcome would still be the same situation as it is today. He pleaded, that the change calls for courageous men and women to stand for the truth.

What is uncertain is whether their distress will lead to more public protests and violence or whether Zimbabweans have had enough and are now be too scared to challenge the authorities again, both decisions understandable."
666,"Kenya&rsquo;s Eliud Kipchoge has won the 39thedition of the London marathon men&rsquo;s elite race. This is now his fourth London Marathon title after crossing the line first in 2:02:37, 18 seconds ahead of Ethiopia&rsquo;s Mosinet Geremew.
Kipchoge made London Marathon history as he became the first man to complete the men&rsquo;s quadruple in London, adding yet another superlative to a glittering marathon CV that includes four Berlin titles and Olympic gold
It was billed as a bout between the reigning champion and another of Britain&rsquo;s sporting knights, Sir Mo Farah, but the European record holder struggled to play a major role as king Kipchoge shrugged off three dogged rivals to smash his own course record.
This is a new course record time for Kipchoge, who has now cemented a place among the world&rsquo;s marathon greats. Described as &lsquo;one of the greatest marathoners&rsquo; in the modern era,&rsquo;, Kipchoge has won an astonishing 11 of the 12 marathons he has participated in, his only loss coming at the hands of Kenyan compatriot Wilson Kipsang at the 2013 Berlin Marathon.
Early this year, he was named Sportsman of the Year at the SOYA awards.
Kenya's Brigid Kosgei claimed the biggest victory of her career when she stunned a rich field to win the elite women's race of the 2019 London Marathon clocking 2:18:20. She led her compatriot Vivian Cheruiyot to a 1-2 Kenyan finish
The 25-year-old Kenyan set a new personal best and now adds the London title to her Chicago win. 
In October last year, Kosgei clocked the third fastest time in history clocking 2:18:35 to win the Chicago Marathon title in windy and wet conditions.Ethiopia's Roza Dereje came in third in a time of 2:20:51.
Two other Kenyans, Gladys Cherono and Mary Keitany came in fourth and fifth respectively."
667,"Have you ever thought that women with naturally elevated levels of testosterone shouldn&rsquo;t be able to compete in women&rsquo;s events? That&rsquo;s the question with which athletics have been grappling over the past decade. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), international sport&rsquo;s highest court, ruled that such athletes could be banned unless they took medication to reduce their testosterone levels.
Unfortunately, Mokgadi Caster Semenya (28) falls under this category. Semenya is a South African middle-distance runner and a 2016 Olympic gold medalist. She recently lost her landmark case against the international athletics body in its bid to change its rules for female athletes who have higher testosterone levels who compete in the 800 to 1500m events.
Semenya, one of the world&rsquo;s greatest female middle-distance runners, may be forced to quit the event she has dominated for a decade. After easily winning the 800-meter race at an international meet in Doha on May 3, the South African athlete was defiant in saying she won&rsquo;t comply with new restrictions that will be placed on her at future competitions. Semenya blazed the field in typical fashion in Doha crossing the line in a time of 1:54:99 which called well be her last time competing on the international arena.
She must now begin taking medication to lower her testosterone levels if she wishes to compete over that distance based on the new rules, which CAS said were necessary to ensure fair competition.
IAAF, the governing body of international athletics, defines athletes like her as having &ldquo;a difference of sexual development (DSD)&rdquo;. And last year,it introduced regulationsforcing such athletes to reduce their testosterone levels if they wished to compete in certain events. Semenya had challenged this in court. Describing the rules as &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo;. But, it added, such discrimination is &ldquo;necessary, reasonable and proportionate&rdquo;.
Most people accept the case for separate male and female categories in sporting events in which physical prowess matters. Defining who belongs to the two categories has, however, created much debate. Different methods have been adopted, from crude physical inspections to genetic tests. All have proved unsatisfactory. Thus leading to the latest dividing line of testosterone.
Male elite athletes lie in the high testosterone band and most female athletes fall into the lower testosterone class, a few women, such as Semenya, have elevated levels that take them into the &ldquo;male&rdquo; category.
So, the IAAF suggests that excluding such women, or forcing them to reduce testosterone levels, helps create a level playing field and protects the integrity of women&rsquo;s sports. That&rsquo;s why Cas accepted IAAF regulations as necessary, reasonable and proportionate, even if discriminatory.
Testosterone certainly aids athletic performance, increasing muscle bulk and the number of red blood cells. Hyperandrogenic women have an advantage over athletes whose testosterone is in the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; range.
On what basis do you exclude athletes because of who they are? Natural testosterone is a human condition. If the concern is really the fairness of condition, those who fear Semenya should address the huge international differences in personal and national income, the most consistent factor determining athletic performance because of the advantages it can buy in better training facilities, nutrition, coaching, medical assistance and so on. Why is it unfair anyway? Elite sport, by definition, is an uneven playing field and the best athletes are not like the rest of us. So why should Semenya not be able to take advantage of her genetic attributes, as every other athlete does?
Many trans activists argue that anyone who identifies as female should be allowed to compete in women&rsquo;s sports. Critics argue that, given the advantages conferred by a male physique, it would be unfair to allow anyone who has been through male puberty to compete as a woman, even if they have transitioned from male to female by taking hormone treatment.
Neither claim seems reasonable. From the perspective of fairness and justice, it would be wrong simply to allow self-identified women who have the physical attributes of men to compete in women&rsquo;s events. It would be equally be wrong to have a blanket ban on transgender women competing in female sports.

668,"US authorities in Philadelphia seized a cargo vessel in June with nearly 20 tons of cocaine on board worth approximately $1.3B. The ship was owned by American multinational investment bank and financial services company JPMorgan Chase.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced Monday that its agents discovered the cocaine inside several shipping containers aboard the MSC Gayane while it was docked in Philadelphia&rsquo;s seaport on June 17. The estimated street value of the seized cocaine is $1.3B making it the largest cocaine seizure ever carried out by the CBP, the agency said.

A source close to the situation said on Wednesday that the ship, is part of a transportation strategy fund run for the bank's asset management unit. Which That means JPMorgan Chase (JPM) does not have any operational control of the vessel, a Liberian-flagged ship that is run by the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company.

At the time, just the drugs were seized by the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency. But the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced on Monday that it had issued a warrant on July 4 that allowed the CBP to take custody of the ship itself as well.

&ldquo;A seizure of a vessel this massive is complicated and unprecedented &mdash; but it is appropriate because the circumstances here are also unprecedented,&rdquo; said US Attorney William McSwain in a statement Monday.

&ldquo;When a vessel brings such an outrageous amount of deadly drugs into Philadelphia waters, my Office and our agency partners will pursue the most severe consequences possible against all involved parties in order to protect our district -- and our country,&rdquo; McSwain added.

The MSC Gayane is owned by JPMorgan Chase but operated by Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Co., Markets Insider reported.

Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) said in a statement on June 18 that &ldquo;unfortunately, shipping and logistics companies are from time to time affected by trafficking problems. MSC has a longstanding history of cooperating with U.S. federal law enforcement agencies to help disrupt illegal narcotics trafficking.&rdquo;

MSC said that the ship was en route to northern Europe at the time it was seized, and that aside from the containers held by authorities in the United States, all other cargoes have been sent along to their destinations on other MSC vessels.

Aside from a small number of containers that are being held by the authorities as part of the investigation, the remaining shipments on the MSC Gayane have been transferred to other vessels and sent on to their respective destinations, MSC said.

Casey Durst, the CBP&rsquo;s Director of Field Operations in Baltimore stated, &ldquo;Seizing a vessel of this size is an unusual enforcement action for CBP, but is indicative of the serious consequences associated with an alleged conspiracy by crewmembers and others to smuggle a record load of dangerous drugs through the United States.&rdquo;

Federal prosecutors are working with the CBP, Homeland Security Investigations, the U.S. Coast Guard and state and local law enforcement to investigate who played a role in an alleged conspiracy by crewmembers and others to smuggle the record load of drugs through the U.S.

The banking giant has not commented on the case, according to reports."
669,"The left-wing politician and former Mexico City mayor Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador has promised no less than to carry out a ""radical transformation"" in his country and to ""eradicate corruption"".

Mr L&oacute;pez Obrador, who is popularly known as ""Amlo"" has been serving since 2018 as the 58th President of Mexico with the message of aiming for renewal resonating with an electorate weary of corruption, soaring crime and economic hardship. Amlo promised to deliver economic growth, jobs and social development programmes.

With that intent, multiple auctions have taken place and will continue to take place in the coming months within Mexico. Selling the homes and cars of criminals and properties seized from drug cartels. 

Houses with swimming pools and escape tunnels, a large ranch and an apartment where a cartel leader was killed were all up for sale. Even though only 9 of the 27 properties on offer actually sold, the auction raised 56.6m pesos ($3m; &pound;2.3m) of the 167m pesos predicted.

 A previous auction raised $1.5m (&pound;117m) by selling the homes and cars of criminals, including at least one former politician. A Lamborghini was among the items on sale.

The Mexican president had pledged that profits from the auction would go towards those affected by drug gang violence and had said that the money would help poor and marginalised communities in the violent state of Guerrero. He has also promised to sell his presidential plane to fund efforts to curb illegal migration."
670,"The massacre on 15 March was New Zealand&rsquo;s worst peacetime mass shooting, prompting the Labour-led coalition government to make comprehensive gun reforms, banning military-style semi-automatics and assault rifles, including related components.
During New Zealand&rsquo;s darkest days fifty one people were killed and another 50 wounded in shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Gunman Brenton Tarrant live-streamed footage of his rampage on Facebook the footage showed the man, armed with semi-automatic weapons, firing indiscriminately at men, women, and children from close range inside the mosque.
Brenton Tarrant is charged with the murder of 51 people, 40 counts of attempted murder and one terrorism charge. However, the Australian has pleaded not guilty to all charges in relation to the Christchurch mosque shootings. 
Appearing via video link at the high court in Christchurch on Friday morning, from a high-security prison in Auckland where he is being held, the 28-year-old Australian sat with a smirk silently as his lawyer Shane Tait, read out his not guilty plea.
About 140 members of the public attended the hearing, a number of the survivors of the attack and relatives of the victims were in court for the hearing and were devastated to hear the non-guilty plea.
High Court Justice Cameron Mander said the trial had been set for 4 May next year, and that Mr. Tarrant would be remanded in custody until a case review hearing on 16 August.
At his last court appearance in April, he was ordered to undergo mental health assessments to determine whether he was fit to stand trial.
Judge Mander said in a statement on Friday: ""No issue arises regarding the defendant's fitness to plead, to instruct counsel, and to stand his trial. A fitness hearing is not required.""
Mander also lifted suppression on the identities of the complainants, which means all alleged victims, apart from the three aged under 18, can now be named. He also allowed the use of Tarrant&rsquo;s image in the media, lifting an order from 16 March that his face must be pixellated.
The decision in court sparked anger among relatives of the victims who discussed the hearing outside, Yama Nabi, whose father was killed in the mosque shootings, said the prospect of a trial was &ldquo;hurtful for the families&rdquo;.
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t need any more. They got their hearts broken.&rdquo;
Janna Ezat, whose son was killed at the Al Noor mosque, cried after learning the trial would go ahead, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so frustrated&rdquo;.
May God send peace and tranquility upon the people of New zealand and recompense them with better. #AllLivesMatter"
671,"The Toronto Raptors won a wild game 114-110 against Golden State Warriors in Oakland for their first NBA title. Toronto won the series 4-2, finishing it off a few minutes after Klay Thompson used crutches to hobble out of Oracle and into perhaps an uncertain future.
The game ended the 2019 championship series and was a first-time win for the Raptors, who made their NBA Finals debut in the 24th season.
The leading team switched throughout the game, with the Raptors clinging to a one-point lead with 18 seconds left. The Raptors sunk a one-shot technical with 0.9 seconds remaining, pushing them up by two.
Klay Thompson was injured in the third quarter, landing awkwardly on his leg while trying to dunk. There was no word on the severity of the injury. Thompson registered 30 points to lead all scorers before leaving the game.
Despite Thompson's absence, the Warriors kept battling and were able to stick with the Raptors until the final seconds. After a late turnover by the Raptors, they even had a chance to win it in the closing seconds, butSteph Curry's3 didn't go down. A bizarre sequence in the aftermath led to the Warriors calling a timeout they didn't have, which effectively ended the game.
Kyle Lowry finished with 26 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists to lead the Raptors. Pascal Siakam also went for 26, while Kawhi Leonard andFred VanVleeteach added 22 of their own. Thompson led the Warriors with 30 points, and Andre Iguodala chipped in 22 points.
For the Golden State Warriors, it was a must-win battle at home at Oracle Arena in Oakland, where they were the defending champs aiming for theirthird title in a row and fourth in the last five years.
The Warriors suffered a loss with Klay Thompson injuring his knee and leaving the stadium on crutches. It was all too familiar for the Warriors. In game 5 of the NBA finals, Kevin Durant, a two-time NBA Finals MVP with the Warriors, was helped off the court after suffering an Achilles injury, while his team went on to win the game 106-105."
672,"An eight-year-old nomadic girl, who was kidnapped on January 10 last year, was raped in captivity in a small village temple in Kathua district. The girl, who belonged to a Muslim nomadic tribe, was kidnapped on January 10 was drugged, starved and repeatedly raped for days. Finally, she was strangled and her head was bashed in with a rock. 
The child's mutilated body was found in a forest area on January 17. Three days later, one of the accused - reportedly a juvenile - was arrested by police. He is aformer government officer, Sanji Ram's nephew. The trial in his case is yet to begin because a petition on determining his age is yet to be heard by the Jammu and Kashmir High Court.

The case of the eight-year-old girl's gang-rape, torture and killing in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua in January last year shocked the entire country leading to street protests calling for justice for the child.The Kathua rape and murder was one among many high-profile cases that prompted India to introduce a new law which mandated the death penalty to anyone convicted of raping a child under 12.
Amid nationwide outrage, the case was handed over to the Crime Branch, following which a police sub-inspector and a head constable were arrested for destroying evidence. Sanji Ram, a retired revenue officer, surrendered on March 20 last year.
The verdict in the rape and murder case was delivered by a special court on Monday. The in-camera trial in the case that sent tremors through the nation ended on June 3, when district and sessions judge Tejwinder Singh had announced that the verdict was likely to be delivered on June 10.
Sanji Ram, who was believed to be the mastermind, was among those convicted by a special fast-track court in Pathankot. His son is the only one let off, over lack of evidence. Investigations suggested that the girl was raped and murdered in an effort to terrorize the nomads frequenting the Kathua area and drive them out. Six out of the seven men were convicted and they include; Sanji Ram, Deepak Khajuria, Surinder Verma, Pravesh Doshi, Tilak Raj, and Anand Dutta Verma may face a life term or the death penalty.

Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah after the announcement of the convicted tweeted;

673,"On July 4, 17-year-old Elijah Al-Amin entered a Circle K convenience store in Peoria, Arizona. He was followed inside by 27-year-old Michael Paul Adams, who approached the teen from behind and stabbed him with a pocketknife and slit the boy&rsquo;s throat before fleeing the scene.

Shortly after the incident, Adams was arrested near the store. While a July 4 statement from the Peoria Police Department noted that officers were still looking for information about Adams&rsquo;s motive, a July 5 report from the Arizona Republic said Adams attacked the 17-year-old boy that he did it because the boy&rsquo;s rap music made him feel &ldquo;unsafe.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Adams told police rap music makes him feel &lsquo;unsafe&rsquo; because he had been attacked by people who listen to rap music in the past,&rdquo; the outlet reported, citing police records filed in a local court. &ldquo;He also said people who listen to rap music are a threat to him and the community.&rdquo;

The report added that Adams said he was only threatened by the music and had no interactions with the teen before stabbing him. Adams claimed he felt a need to be &ldquo;proactive rather than reactive.&rdquo;

Adams was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. He is being held on a $1 million bond and is expected to appear in court July 15.

Just two days before the stabbing, Adams had been released from prison, according to Andrew Wilder, a spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Corrections. Adams had previously faced numerous charges, including aggravated assault of a correctional officer, assault with a weapon, marijuana violations, and theft.

His lawyer, Jacie Cotterell, told AZ Central that Adams had been homeless upon his release and did not have access to the mental health resources he needed, saying he was &ldquo;set up for failure.&rdquo; Cotterell argued that her client wasn&rsquo;t given medication or other support upon his release.&ldquo;They released him to the streets with no medication, no meds, with no way to care for himself.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is a failing of the Department of Corrections. This is easily foreseeable and that is an issue,&rdquo; she added.

The case has outraged Al-Amin&rsquo;s family as well as the broader public, who argue that at a time of high-profile incidents of black people being harassed or confronted in public spaces, listening to rap music should not have cost Elijah his life. The hashtag #JusticeforElijah trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared articles about the boy&rsquo;s murder and called for Adams&rsquo;s conviction.
Critics are also angered by Adams&rsquo;s lawyer&rsquo;s claim that the attack was motivated not by racism, but untreated mental health issues. Al-Amin&rsquo;s family says that argument is being used to minimize the attack on their son, adding that they believe Elijah was the victim of a hate crime. With activists and observers have highlighted similarities between Al-Amin&rsquo;s death and other incidents of violence against black teenagers. One commonly cited example is the 2012 death of Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old black teen shot and killed when a white man fired into a car. The man had previously argued with Davis and his friends over their music, complaining that it was too loud.
Elijah&rsquo;s mother, Serina Rides, told Fox 10 Phoenix that she thinks Adams and his lawyer are &ldquo;hiding behind mental illness&rdquo; as an excuse for racist motivations for the killing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so numb and hurt to the core of my soul,&rdquo; Rides said. &ldquo;But I have to stay focused because I know that&rsquo;s what he would want and to make sure justice is served for him.&rdquo;

&ldquo;My last words to him was, &lsquo;Elijah, I love you,&rsquo; and he said, &lsquo;I love you too, mom,&rsquo;&rdquo; Rides told the Fox news station. &ldquo;Those were his last words to me and I&rsquo;m at peace with that.&rdquo;

674,"A horrific video has circulated all over social media, showing a pregnant woman 24-year-old Iesha Harper struggling to obey police orders to leave her car as she holds her two small children aged 1 and 4. 
At one point, while the children are still in the vehicle, a police officer can be seen pointing a gun at the car as another yells, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going to fucking get shot.&rdquo;
At another point, one of the officers shouts at the girl&rsquo;s father, 22-year-old Dravon Ames, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put a fucking cap in your fucking head.&rdquo;
The incident, May 29th, another video of police officers abusing their authority. According to the Arizona Republic guns were pointed at the unarmed pregnant woman because her 4-year-old daughter allegedly stole a doll from a dollar store. 
According to Ames, the incident started when police approached the couple after they had parked at their babysitter&rsquo;s apartment complex. Someone anonymously called the police to report that the couple&rsquo;s daughter had stolen a doll from a nearby Family Dollar. 
The couple believes the daughter took the toy by accident. The couple submitted a filing, Ames says in the filing that the officers hadn&rsquo;t used their lights or sirens before walking over to their parked car.
In the video that a resident of the apartment complex recorded, an officer can be seen pointing his gun and shouting at Ames and Harper who is inside the car with their daughters, to get out. 

In the couples claim, Ames says that an officer walked to the backseat door but couldn&rsquo;t open it because it was broken. He adds that the officer then slammed his fist against the window and told Harper to open the door and put her hands up.
&ldquo;Get your fucking hands up!&rdquo; the officer shouts repeatedly in one video, with his gun raised. She shouts at the officers that she can&rsquo;t open the door.
When Harper complains in the same video that she has her children with her, one officer replies, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fucking care, put your hands up. Ames, audibly in distress, repeats: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t put my hands up, I have a fucking baby in my arms, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m pregnant.&rdquo;
The filing document notes that another officer pointed his gun at Ames in the front seat and pulled him out of the car. Another video shows Ames lying on the ground while an officer handcuffs him. 
According to the claim, the officer then stood Ames up, told him to spread his legs, and kicked him in his right leg. The claim reports that Ames then collapsed, and the officer pulled him back up again, before punching him in the back as he pushed him against the police vehicle.
&ldquo;When I tell you to do something, you fucking do it!&rdquo; an officer can be heard shouting at the handcuffed Ames in one bystander video. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Ames says. The officer pushes him against the vehicle and repeats the same line. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not compliant with me,&rdquo; the officer screams. &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Ames says, in what seems to be a confused voice.
Around the same time, the complaint recounts, when Harper stepped out of the car, one of the officers tried to take one of her daughters from her as he took Harper into custody. In the filing, she says he ordered her to place her 1-year-old daughter on the hot pavement, and that she refused. In the video, as the officers surround her and she holds the 4-year-old by the hand and the 1-year-old in her arms, she says, while crying, &ldquo;this is all for nothing.&rdquo; She hands off her children to another woman at the apartment complex to allow the police to handcuff her.

The couple filed a $10 million claim against the city of Phoenix after the sickening acts of several police officers who repeatedly threatened to shoot them during the physically aggressive encounter. 

In their claim which the couple filed Thursday, requesting $2.5 million in compensation for each family member, Harper and Ames say the police officers&rsquo; actions amounted to battery, unlawful imprisonment, false arrest, and a violation of their civil rights that left them with emotional distress. They claim the officer harmed their 1-year-old daughter when they pulled her arm and harmed Ames when they arrested him.

The couple also says they kept Ames in the back of the police car for a half hour and that they were only released after another police lieutenant arrived at the scene. Neither was formally arrested or charged with a crime.
Phoenix police, who have not released the officers&rsquo; names, have said they are investigating the incident.
 &ldquo;The Phoenix Police Department takes all allegations of misconduct seriously and for this reason, this incident is currently being investigated by the Professional Standards Bureau,&rdquo; the police statement said. Phoenix told ABC 15 that the officer who cursed at, threatened, and kicked Ames is on a &ldquo;non-enforcement assignment.&rdquo; The officer who pointed a gun at Harper and her children inside the vehicle remains on patrol.
Senator Martin Quezada took to social media expressing his devastation and disgust, tweeting, ""This is everything that's wrong with #LawEnforcement today. My #LD29 #Maryvale community deserves better than this type of inexcusable and unjustifiable rage and abuse of power from the @phoenixpolice. @PHXDistrict5 @PhxDistrict8"""
675,"Shukri Abdi was last seen in the river - parts of which are 20ft (6m) deep - off Dunster Road, Bury at 19:55 BST on the 27th June.
Greater Manchester Police said it was treating what happened as a ""tragic incident"" and did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances. However the family seems to disagree with police conclusions, the family of the 12-year-old refugee schoolgirl said she was being bullied and they don't believe her death was an accident. Shukri Yahya Abdi's grief-stricken mother, Zamzam Ture, has completely rejected police statements saying her daughter was ""denied the truth"".
The family alleges Shukri was being bullied by fellow pupils at her school in Bury, Greater Manchester, and they have accused staff of failing to protect her.
Ms Ture, whose family came to the UK two years ago as refugees from wartorn Somalia, added: ""The school where my daughter was bullied ... I had been complaining to forever."" The devastated mum claims she had complained to the school ""many times"" about children who were allegedly bullying her daughter.
She said: ""I told them to discipline them or to keep [Shukri] behind and I would pick her up.
""I asked them if they would be responsible for her wellbeing everyday. I would pick her up in the afternoon.
""A boy who bothered my daughter multiple times, I visited the school and his family.
""He said all the kids were insulting her and so he did too.
""He said that's why he did it, the other kids were doing it too.
""He's at home now. He has been excluded.""
A spokesman for Broad Oak Sports College said staff are working with the family ""in respect of any concerns which have been raised about the school"" and anti-bullying policies will be reviewed.
Responding to claims that the schoolgirl was pushed into the river, a Greater Manchester Police spokesman told Mirror Online the probe found no truth to the allegations, adding: ""It doesn't match with our investigation.""
The family doesn't believe she would go to the river miles from her home with children from her school knowing well that she doesn&rsquo;t know how to swim.
Shukri is understood to have been with two other girls when she ended up in the river.
Maz Saleem, who has been supporting the family and a campaign for a wider investigation into the death, wrote on Facebook: ""It is alleged that Shukri was constantly bullied at school and was led to the river. According to her family she couldn't swim.""
In a video posted on social media, Ms Ture said: ""The police said [to me] your daughter died in an accident, she was playing with other kids, she died there.
""The other kids were not wet or harmed, so it was a denial.""
""She was denied the truth.
""The police haven't shown us any evidence. I have no proof of what happened.""
Shukri's cousin, Mustaf Omar Mohamed, Shukri&rsquo;s, told the Muslim news website 5 Pillars: The police has told the media that it was a tragic accident so they have just repeated that, but we don&rsquo;t think that stacks up.
""We don&rsquo;t believe it was an accident, we believe there is more to this story and we don&rsquo;t believe we are getting the answers and support we deserve from the police and the school.""
He added: &ldquo;We know that Shukri was being bullied and so do the school and the police. It was name-calling and physical. I don&rsquo;t know why she was being bullied but she was a timid, scared, vulnerable girl so she was an easy target. Her mum went to the school to report it and was even in the process of taking her out of school.""
He said the family wants a ""proper investigation"" by the police and the school.
A spokesman for Broad Oak Sports College said: ""The school and Oak Learning Partnership Multi Academy Trust were deeply saddened to receive news of Shukri&rsquo;s tragic death.
""Shukri was a lovely young girl, always smiling, always wanting to please people and worked hard. She had a beautiful personality and a loving and supportive family.
""Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are now with the family at this time and we will be supporting them and all our children through this difficult period.
Ms Ture said she wants to ""see justice"" for her daughter.
She added: ""If the rights we came to the country for exist, I want something done."""
676,"Iranian forces have shot down a United States military drone, a move that appears to have escalated the volatile situation raising fears that a major military confrontation could erupt between Tehran and Washington in the Gulf.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard said it had shot down an ""intruding American spy drone"" after it entered into the country's territory Thursday, according to state-run Press TV.

A US official confirmed to CNN a drone had been shot down, but said the incident occurred in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz, one of the world's most vital shipping routes.

Press TV reported the downed drone was a US-made RQ-4 Global Hawk, while the US official said it was a MQ-4C Triton. Both are unmanned surveillance aircraft developed by weapons manufacturer Northrop Grumman.

Regardless, the head of the Revolutionary Guard Corps, Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, said the shooting down of the drone had sent a warning to the US.
""The only way for our enemies to be safe is to respect our sovereignty, national security, and the national interests of the great Iranian nation,"" Salami said, according to Iran's semi-official Tasnim News Agency.

Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) force made it clear that ""It was shot down when it entered Iran's airspace near the Kouhmobarak district in the south."" 

Salami said that Iran does not want war with any country, but we are completely, and totally, ready and prepared for war."" ""Borders are our red line,"" Salami told a crowd in the western city of Sanandaj. ""Any enemy that violates the borders will be annihilated"".

A senior Iranian security official said on Wednesday Iran would ""strongly respond"" to any violation of its territory.
""Our airspace is our red line and Iran has always responded and will continue to respond strongly to any country that violates our airspace,"" the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council as saying.

Reuters quoted Cap. Bill Urban, a spokesman for the US Central Command, as saying ""no US aircraft were operating in Iranian airspace"" Thursday.

Tables were turned at the beginning of the week with Trump&rsquo;s administration's decision of deploying 1,000 additional troops and more military resources to the Middle East. The forces are being sent in response to what Washington called ""hostile behavior by Iranian forces that threaten United States personnel and interests across the region.""

US officials blame Iran for conducting attacks against oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, and the US President himself last week accused Iran of being behind the provocation, telling Fox News, ""It was them that did it.""

Tehran has categorically denied the accusations, and President Hassan Rouhani said the country does not seek war but ""is determined to show its hopefulness and vitality and defeat the enemy's plot.""

Meanwhile, US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook headed to the Middle East for meetings in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Kuwait and Bahrain to discuss ""Iran's regional aggression"", the State Department said.
""He will also share additional US intelligence on the range of active threats Iran currently poses to the region,"" it said in a statement.

In protest at Trump's ""maximum pressure"" sanctions strategy, Iran announced in May it would start enriching uranium at a higher level unless European signatories to the nuclear deal protected its oil and banking sectors within 60 days.

The US has vowed that Iran will never possess nuclear weapons."
677,"The crisis in Sudan can be traced back to December 2018, when President Bashir's government imposed emergency austerity measures in an attempt to stave off economic collapse which sparked demonstrations in the east over living standards and the anger spread to Khartoum. The protests broadened into demands for the removal of Mr. Bashir who had been in leadership for 30 years, the protestors also demanded the removal of his government. 
The protests reached a high on 6 April, when demonstrators occupied the square in front of the military's headquarters to demand that the army force the president out. Five days later, the military announced that the president had been overthrown.
The situation in Sudan hasn&rsquo;t gotten better, even after a council of generals assumed power on 11 April. The seven-member Transitional Military Council (TMC) is led by Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan. The council says it needs to be in charge to ensure order and security.
When the military took power in April, demonstrators stayed put outside its headquarters and insisted that it transfer authority to a civilian administration.
Talks between the ruling generals and the protest organizers, who have come together under the umbrella group Alliance for Freedom and Change, initially showed little sign of progress, but they eventually came to an agreement.
Demonstrators argued that Mr. Bashir's regime is so deeply entrenched that a long transition is needed to dismantle his political network and allow fair elections. The two sides also agreed on the structure of a new government - including a sovereign council, a cabinet, and a legislative body. Even though representatives of the protesters had been in negotiations with the military over who will take control following the removal of long-time President Omar al-Bashir. The military leaders scrapped all of the agreements on 3 June and said fresh elections would be held within nine months.
The TMC's head said they had decided to ""stop negotiating with the Alliance for Freedom and Change and cancel what had been agreed on"". And of course, this angered the protest movement, which had insisted on a transition period of at least three years so it could ensure the elections are free and fair.
Former British ambassador to Sudan, Rosalind Marsden, told the BBC that the snap election would ""simply pave the way for much of the old regime to come back into power"".
The situation led to a political crisis after security forces opened fire on pro-democracy protesters in the capital, Khartoum. Which consequently led The African Union suspending Sudan's membership ""with immediate effect"", amid an upsurge of violence in the capital that has seen dozens killed. 
""The AU Peace and Security Council has with immediate effect suspended the participation of the Republic of Sudan in all AU activities until the effective establishment of a Civilian-led Transitional Authority, as the only way to allow Sudan to exit from the current crisis,"" the AU tweeted on Thursday.
The pan-African body has warned of further action if power is not transferred to civilian authority - a key demand of pro-democracy protesters. Opposition activists say a paramilitary group has killed 108 people this week, but officials put the figure at 46. Regardless, the chairman of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, on Monday called for an ""immediate and transparent"" investigation into the killings.
The military faced international condemnation for launching the violent attack on protesters in Khartoum on 3 June which reportedly left at least 46 dead. The US condemned what it called a ""brutal attack"" and the UK said the military council bore ""full responsibility"".
In response, the TMC expressed ""sorrow for the way events escalated"", saying that the operation had targeted ""trouble makers and petty criminals"".
Talks between opposition activists and the ruling interim military council have since broken down. On Thursday the UK Foreign Office summoned the Sudanese ambassador to raise concerns about the developments.
After security forces swept in and opened fire on unarmed protesters in the square on Monday, the head of the military council, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, announced that the agreement was canceled and an election would take place within nine months.An appeal from Saudi Arabia to resume talks, Gen Burhan reversed course and said the military council would ""open our arms to negotiate with no restriction"". But the offer was rejected by the opposition activists, who said the military council could not be trusted after the crackdown."
678,"The BBC has found new evidence of the increasing control and suppression of Islam in China's far western region of Xinjiang &ndash; including the widespread destruction of mosques.

More than a million Uighur Muslims have been arbitrarily detained in China&rsquo;s Xinjiang Province by the Chinease government. Chinese officials are concerned that the Uighur people hold extremist and separatist ideas, and they view the camps as a way of eliminating threats to China&rsquo;s territorial integrity, government, and population.

Human rights organizations, UN officials, and many foreign governments are urging China to stop the crackdown. But Chinese officials justify their actions, they say that vocational training centers do not infringe on Uighurs&rsquo; human rights. Officials have refused to share information about the detention centers and have prohibited foreign investigators and journalists from examining them.

According to experts and government officials approximately 800,000 to 2 million Uighurs and other Muslims, including ethnic Kazakhs and Uzbeks, have been detained since April 2017. Sadly, outside of the camps is no better, the 11 million Uighurs living in Xinjiang have continued to endure suffering from a decades-long crackdown by Chinese authorities.

Most people in the camps have never been charged with crimes. The detainees seem to have been targeted for a variety of reasons, according to media reports, including traveling to or contacting people from any of the twenty-six countries China considers sensitive, such as Turkey and Afghanistan; attending their place of worship (mosques) and sending texts containing Quranic verses. 

Human rights groups say, their only crime is being Muslim!!!

These ordinary muslims are labeled as extremists simply for practicing their religion. When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, apart of him dies inside.

Information on what actually happens in the camps is limited, but many detainees who have since fled China describe harsh conditions. Detainees are forced to pledge loyalty to the CCP and renounce Islam. Some reported prison like conditions, with cameras and microphones monitoring their every move. Whereas others claim they were tortured and subjected to sleep deprivation during interrogations. Some contemplated suicide or witnessed others kill themselves.

In March 2017, Xinjiang&rsquo;s government passed an anti-extremism law that prohibited people from growing long beards and wearing veils in public. It also officially recognized the use of training centers to eliminate extremism.

Once the camps began receiving international media attention, government officials denied their existence. Then, starting in October 2018, officials started calling them &ldquo;vocational education and training programs.&rdquo; In March 2019, their official name became &ldquo;vocational training centers,&rdquo; and Xinjiang&rsquo;s governor, Shohrat Zakir, described them as &ldquo;boarding schools&rdquo; that provide job skills to &ldquo;trainees,&rdquo; who are voluntarily admitted and allowed to leave the camps. This was merely a coverup strategy as human rights organizations say detainees are prevented from exiting as they please.

The government has completely resisted international pressure to allow in outside investigators, saying anything happening inside Xinjiang is an internal issue. It denies that people are forced to denounce Islam, are detained against their will, and experience abuse in the camps. In early 2019, it organized several trips for foreign diplomats to visit Xinjiang and tour a center; a U.S. official criticized them as &ldquo;highly choreographed.&rdquo;

Much of the world has condemned China&rsquo;s detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang. The UN human rights chief and other UN officials have demanded access to the camps. The European Union has called on China to respect religious freedom and change its policies in Xinjiang. And human rights organizations have urged China to immediately shut down the camps and answer questions about disappeared Uighurs. Unfortunately many Muslim nations remain silent.
Let their silence grow with noise, let their silence be loud, loud as all sounds can be."
679,"Nicki Minaj has been announced as a headline act for a music festival in Saudi Arabia at the Jeddah World Fest on 18 July. The news sparked confusion across social media over how the rapper can perform in her typically revealing outfits and rap/sing explicit lyrics in an ultra-conservative kingdom.

Some people online were in utter shock with one Twitter user tweeting,
""Imagine waking up from a three year coma and the first thing you hear is Nicki Minaj [is] opening a musical festival in Saudi Arabia, I'd honestly think I woke up in some parallel universe.""

In a video posted on Twitter, a woman wearing a headscarf questioned why the authorities were welcoming the rapper, while requiring Saudi women wear the abaya - a long loose-fitting robe used to cover their bodies in public.
""She's going to go and shake her ass and all her songs are indecent and about sex and shaking ass,"" she said. ""And then you tell me to wear the abaya. What the hell?""

According to the BBC the recent loosening of restrictions on many forms of entertainment is part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious plan to diversify the country's economy. However, this goal has yet to be achieved as Minaj is not the first performer to cause controversy by accepting an invitation to perform in Saudi Arabia. Mariah Carey defied calls from human rights activists to cancel her performance in the kingdom, while rapper Nelly came under fire for performing a ""men only"" concert.

As far as YouTube, the app for the video sharing platform can be used on devices such as the Fire TV Stick 4K and the Fire TV Cube, according to the blog.
Amazon promisesthat more Fire TV devices will be getting the YouTube app &ldquo;in the coming months,&rdquo; along with support for YouTube Kids and the live YouTube TV service that&rsquo;s set to release later this year.
Notably absent from the announcement is Amazon&rsquo;s Echo Show devices, which was excluded when Amazon and Google first announced the deal earlier this year and still has no official YouTube app. (Google&rsquo;s own smart displays, like the Home Hub and recently released Nest Hub Max, do have YouTube support.)
The access comes after it was announced in April that Amazon and Google agreed to bring their video streaming apps to each other&rsquo;s devices, ending a dispute between the companies."
681,"Sadie Roberts-Joseph, 75, an activist and the founder of an African-American museum in Baton Rouge was found dead in the trunk of a car 3 miles away from her home.
Roberts-Joseph founded the Odell S. Williams Now and Then African American Museum in 2001, where she had been hosting the city's Juneteenth celebration for years. She also founded Community Against Drugs and Violence, a non-profit organization focused on creating a safer environment for children in North Baton Rouge.
In a recent interview with ABC affiliate station WBRZ in Baton Rouge, Roberts-Joseph said her work at the museum and the annual Juneteenth event was meant ""to celebrate, to embrace"" African American history and to ""learn of our past and to be able to move forward in unity.""
""Our detectives are working diligently to bring the person or persons responsible for this heinous act to justice,"" the Baton Rouge Police Department said in a statement.
""Ms. Sadie was a tireless advocate of peace in the community,"" the police department said in a statement. ""Ms. Sadie is a treasure to our community, she will be missed by BRPD and her loss will be felt in the community she served.""
Local politicians, advocates and community members on Saturday mourned Roberts-Joseph's death.
Louisiana state Rep. C. Denise Marcelle called Roberts-Joseph an ""amazing woman"" who loved history.
""My heart is empty ... as I learned last night that Ms. Sadie Roberts Joseph was found murdered!"" Marcelle said in a statement posted on Facebook. ""She never bothered anyone, just wanted to expand her African American Museum downtown, where she continually hosted the Juneteenth Celebration yearly. I loved working with her and am saddened by her death.... whoever knows what happened to her, please contact the authorities and say something.""
In another Facebook post NAACP Baton Rouge Branch wrote,
""We lost a Cultural Legend Yesterday! #RIP Sadie Roberts Joseph,"" the group wrote. ""From reviving Juneteenth, to the Culture preserved at Her Museum, she was a trendsetter and icon in this City.""
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner&rsquo;s Office will conduct an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death.
Police investigating the activist's death urged anyone with information about the case to call police detectives at 225-389-4869 or Crime Stoppers at 225-344-STOP (7867)."
683,"Accessories are every girl's best friend! That means that actually, we should strive to build an accessory collection. Talk about belts, scarves, jewelry, good shoes, hats, caps and even bags!


While not everyone will be good at picking accessories, it's always important to build a minimalistic collection and build it up. Normally, many ladies including me will start with a good bag, a belt and some nice jewelry. And that's just so fine! Anyway, if you havethese must-have accessories, it will be easier to finish up your looks.
I must admit that I am a fan of waist belts since I have as much of them. Waist belts can be so good for cinching the waist for an accentuated look or even tying up an oversized look. Many will also belt up detailed dresses and here, I share a guide:
HOW TO BELT UP A DETAILED DRESS
A detailed dress esentially stands out because of the so much design going around. It can have zips, slits, a bold colors, prints or even patterns. Indeed, the dress becomes sort of busy. This means that you have to be very keen at how you accessorize.
Well, here are 3 ways:
1. Pick a dress that is not so detailed.
I advise getting a dress with at most three details. For example: a high neckline, long slit and back zip or a V-neck and a side slit. That ensures that your dress is not too busy to be accessorized.
2. Belt up your detailed dress along your high waist.
Your high waist is just around your tummy area. If you have to cinch your waist, the do so along this place since it accentuates your bottom.
3. Don't wear more accessories.
A belt is such a bold accessory thus if you have to wear more accessories, don't wear bulky accessories. Keep them to a minimum of 3 accessories whose color perfectly compliment each other.
Cheers! What do you think about mycamel dress?

684,"My Life Into Fashion Blogging!

​Everyone has a story behind everything they do&hellip;why and how I got into the intoxicating world of fashion and having a soft spot for the gorgeous world of designs, colorsand shapes is also my story&hellip;

&ldquo; Behind the wide, rolled-down curtains , I listen to the applaud to the previous model . She, with a fine petite body dressed ingreenAfricanattire and carrying a pot, is just from the runway and it is my turn. Being the cultural night in school, I have crafted an African costume that was unique to myItesotraditions since I always enjoy cultural distinctions.
Ahaaa! The music beats softly as I model through the runway. I had made myself up. My overall costume: a short skirt made from chunks of green interconnected palm leaves, a top ornamented with red intertwined hibiscus flowers and my sandals, bedecked with green leaves and red flowers.
Whilst, a wistful thought rides me back down to that first moment when I was introduced to the intoxicating world of fashion. I was attending this music festival, busy socializing after our performance, trying to play &lsquo;Tom and Jerry&rsquo;with other guys my age.
From ourAfricanperspective, we are taught that girls have to be curvy as they get into their teen years but this wasn&rsquo;t my case because I was always the slim one among all my peers. Most of the time, people all around me would make fun of my tall yet slim shape to the point of calling names and feeling pity for me. Trust me, if that were you, undergoing hip boosting procedures would be one of yourNewYearresolutions. And mind you, I felt pity for &lsquo;me&rsquo;&hellip;
Anyway, my girlfriends-Dorice,Millicentand I explored the arena, playing hard to get but only stopping for a chat with these &lsquo;hot&rsquo; guys. The game seemed so fun because after all, as a journalist in school, I had to gather news on how the whole event was. They even called me &lsquo;KamemeFm&rsquo;back at school to mean &lsquo;that radio station&rsquo;. Unfortunately, it reached this point where I was left alone and all my girlfriends were hooked up. Back then, that was disheartening although I had to wear that confident face as a journalist.
That was when I heard it: &lsquo;Grace, it&rsquo;s time to look your best!&rsquo;
The flash of a sleeveless orange crop top and a knee-high brown Ankara pencil skirt crossed my mind. All with bold dizzying prints. For a moment, I was frozen. Something about the combination caught my mind and, though I didn&rsquo;t understand, I couldn&rsquo;t think otherwise. Taking a deeper thought, I shifted the ice cream I had over to one arm, and reached out for a pen in myslingbag. I imagined of dressing my petite shape in such a beautiful combination and all I could do is smile. Thought about attending fashion shows, going for photoshoots, being on the cover of huge publications like Elle and Vogue, rocking designer fashion pieces and running my own PR firm.
I want this! I assured myself&hellip;
I remained startled . And completely and totally enamored. After contemplating on what I now wanted , I knew that I was to run with this vision. I rushed back to the bus and rewrote this on my vision board that I would carry everywhere. This was the first time I prioritized something for socializing. Since then, I shifted my attention to the gorgeous world of designs, colors, and shapes.
I opted to surf through the Internet on fashion and Pinterest proved fashionable. Downloading uncountable pictures of fashion enthusiasts , buying the &lsquo;Style &lsquo; and &lsquo;Fashion &lsquo; magazines , following fashion blogs and piling up fashion pages I plucked from the Saturday Nation newspaper became my avocation. Consequently, I made my own fashion scrap book. All my discoveries from the numerous fashion trends were recorded here. I&rsquo;d decorate my bedroom wall with pictures of fashionistas; the white paint now embellished with Lucia Musau&rsquo;s looks, Maria Vizutte&rsquo;sdenimstyles, Macy Stucke&rsquo;s coats, and designer inspirations from their blogs. The crazy patterns and wild mix of colors became spontaneous, and my eyes dwelt on more art-like outfits. It was a world I knew I had to be part of as much as I could not grasp more of it then.
Now cat walking out of the runway, I catch a glimpse of my friend. In my world, I hear her say, &lsquo;This is where you belong!&rsquo;
And here I am&hellip;&hellip;

I have come to discover that what I portray myself with my style tells more of how I feel about ME. Initially, I&rsquo;d get succumbed to the pressure of adding weight since I&rsquo;m flocked by curvy girlfriends. And even so, my efforts to be like them were in vain. It was then that I also thought about starting a blog to inspire slim fashion. I know many undergo such moments but you should enjoy being at your best.

I do! That&rsquo;s just it &mdash; that&rsquo;s what my clothes help me to do. Fashion helps me whip up into a fantasy world &mdash; one where any color rules. Floral,denim, any print rules. Short , long , all materials flirt , and lets me put my hands around that dream ; daring me to incorporate it into my life. I only wish to continue until Dalene Ekirapa becomes a legacy that I will inspire more and more ladies to feel more confident about their bodies. And dress themselves with modesty, class and confidence!

For a typical work day, I see things from the end. As I plan by faith, I see this:
Early mornings of a prayer on my knees, reading the Bible, publishing a post and sharing my posts on social media and Pinterest and having sponsored or themed photoshoots;
Press reviews and meetings;
A beautiful work time with my staff: looking into the day&rsquo;s activities, talking about analytics, setting up an editorial calendar and discussing on content and blog sponsorships;
Nights of product launches, networking, dinners; reading my emails and that newest book on my shelf; writing my book; a skincare routine and close up the day with a payer on my knees.
And times of vacations!

685,"Sometimes we think we fall in love with the right people. Sometimes when we&rsquo;ve fallen so deep we realize it was not worth the fall. It wasn&rsquo;t worth all that pain. All that time you took healing those wounds. Those visible scars you hide beneath your sulky sweater. All those tears that nearly dried your wells. You forgt all the good times. Old good times.
If we all fell in love with the right person from the very start, we would not have to deal with the pain of heartbreak. You would not be clouded with insecurities in the first place. We all dream if not want someone who will love us for the right reasons. Someone who wouldn&rsquo;t look at a season in love and decide it&rsquo;s too cold or it&rsquo;s too hot. But how can light get in if we don&rsquo;t get broken in the first place?
If you love the wrong person, you can have all the tough talks you want and communicate your concerns often but most times, nothing really changes. Sticking with a partner whose order of the day is fights and arguments is no difference with living in a house full of smoke. When it stops smoking, you get in. You take all that pain and emotional torture from a snail that doesn&rsquo;t even see you as an equal. You find yourself imaging who the person could be rather who they actually are. You create this Disney fantasy in your smoky head while ignoring the realities of the situation.
Every time we keep going back to people who are not the best for us and sadly, we know it. Living in our shadows. We make choices that are not aligned with who we truly are. We die inside, while we beat up ourselves for relationships fail. We desire for potential and lack compassion for ourselves. You forget before you even got involved with this person in the first place, before you became a thing, you were all alone, with the world which you don&rsquo;t even know.
Until you let go of a situation that seems right but isn&rsquo;t truly what you want, lessons that you&rsquo;ll never break away from will be your daily dose. The moment you realize you guys have not been on the same page all this time, you will flip your own page alone; thanks to new beginnings. It has never been easy to let go of the past. We carry them everywhere. But when the pain of holding on is greater than the pain of letting go, it&rsquo;s time to break bridges. Until you break from these ties and reclaim your life and leave yourself for you, you won&rsquo;t see the light.

686,"This hurt relentlessly mutating to my depths,
Feeling this unbridgeable distance closing in: it&rsquo;s like I
walked a thousand miles and didn&rsquo;t even come close.
Tired of coming back every time you leave yet I find myself chasing, running after what could still be left.

I drown in this catastrophic sob that aligns my every territory;
it makes my guts bold in a way.
This likeness of desperate redemption clouding my slain ache.
Abandoned among the dead.
Trying to get my way back but I can&rsquo;t seem to get this path that leads me.
Been near death, worn out from this burden.
Taking a step these shadows scream, afraid of going back.
Going in circles trying to find a stand.
Seems I&rsquo;m living in an infinite fiction of loss.
This pain so infuriating demands to be felt: surpassing all I ever lived for.

I was barely 18, shamelessly riding, going with what the winds brought.
Robbing you of this evangelical zeal: scared I have to carry that too.
It was only a moment, it&rsquo;s a pity ill never give back this that I took.
I&rsquo;m sorry I was the first&hellip;I was so na&iuml;ve to think we would last.
Looking at the horizon I hope the sun never comes out.

The rains hit us so hard, it&rsquo;s sad we couldn&rsquo;t survive the floods.
Weighing me down I cried for both of us so you won&rsquo;t lose your
tears with the river.
I&rsquo;m sorry I wasn&rsquo;t built enough.
I&rsquo;m sorry this biceps and triceps only came
a few months after our tragedy.
I&rsquo;m sorry I never made you scream loud enough.
But one thing, I am not sorry for walking with you when this world was against us.
Holding your hands in the dark.
Kissing you when you were scared.
Building flames even when our walls were afraid to cave in&hellip;
tracing adorations across my body.
Breaking ice melting with every thrust.
Disappearing in the ends of orgasmic resurrection.

Now we died with those demons that used to arouse every bit
Of our mad existence.
That day when we let our souls break for emptiness.
Tearing with every fault to sad pits of agony.
These pieces of mirror finding each other&rsquo;s demise.
Let&rsquo;s give these suffering souls a break:
Let&rsquo;s liberate them from these chains of imperial affliction
Why should we pain when all there is, is to always go back?
Why should we bleed our hearts?
Let&rsquo;s walk a new path; of beautiful thorns and roses.
Let me carry you once more.
Let&rsquo;s grace this storm together.
Let&rsquo;s run from all these and be part of the great galaxy.
Let&rsquo;s travel to the dead of the world,
where the dark night rises.
Let me carry you, let me feel all your scars with a touch of my tongue.
And even in my blind wake&hellip;
Let&rsquo;s rewrite our stars.

This post starts off an Instagram growth strategy series. Focusing mainly on ways to be fully optimized so you can be found in the Top Posts algorithm.
Users were dissatisfied when Instagram launched its news feed algorithm, replacing the previous popular chronological feed system. The height of frustration can be well estimated from the fact that a petition, which called for the reversal of this change, earned over300,000 signatories in merely 24 hours. 
""Instagram since that controversial nix from a chronological feed, made it seem even harder than ever to get more followers, reach target audiences, and improve engagement on your posts,"" said Tilly, my Marketing course mate.

But that's not entirely true! I bet this may be news to someone reading this who never noticed or heard about the change in the feed system.
The good news is, once you understand the dynamics of the Instagram algorithm, you'll be able to draft a master strategy to boost your presence on the platform. Before I move on to anything, you'd need to understand the following variables as used to evaluate a feed: An Edge, Edgerank, Affinity, Weight and Time Decay.

AnEdgeis inherently everything that happens on the platform.Examples of Edges would bestatus updates, comments, likes,andshares.There are many more Edges than the examples above&mdash;any action that happens within the platform is an Edge.
Edgerankranks Edges in the News Feed. EdgeRank looks at all of the Edges that are connected to the User, then ranks each Edge based on importance to the User.Objects with the highest EdgeRank will conventionally go to the top of the News Feed.
Affinityis a one-way relationship between a User and an Edge. It could be understood as to how close of a &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; a Brand and a Fan may have.Affinity is built by repeated interactions.Actions such as Commenting, Liking, Sharing, and even Messaging can influence a User&rsquo;sAffinity. Affinity can be based on a number of interactions with your friend, weight of each interaction and time since your last interaction.
Weightis a value system created.Commenting is more involved and therefore deemed more valuable than a Like.
Time Decay isa factor based on how long the edge was created. As anEdgeages, it loses value.

This post marks the part-1 of this#instagrowthstrategyseries.I trust you found the above insightful. Do familiarise yourselves with the variables and stay tuned for the next episode!

687,"Allowing yourself to heal, confronting the doubt and realizing that the decision you made was the right one is the ultimate gift from a breakup. Truth is things will be pretty difficult after a break up. The rains will hit you so hard that you will forget the sight of the sun. It&rsquo;s like hitting the rock bottom. You&rsquo;ll hope it&rsquo;s a dream and that the next minute you wake up everything will go back to normal. You feel this emptiness inside you. You feel like this big hole inside your heart will never be filled. It&rsquo;s like being stabbed over and over again and there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing you can do about it. It&rsquo;s like the last snowfalls of the winter.
Problem is we let grief consume us. You wallow in self-pity like you never had a life outside the relationship. Many times we dwell in denial and forsake ourselves. It&rsquo;s okay to feel lost especially when you guys had been dating for a long time, because obviously after all these years your thoughts, feelings and patterns have been in unison with the other individual. In the process you lose yourself.
We forget to pick ourselves up every time we fall. Go out with friends. Eat ice cream and watch dumb movies together. Laugh till you cry with them. Allow yourself to come out of your trapped body. Explore yourself. The steep hills and winding paths in your soul. Even though this may take a long time. After a break up we usually see things that we could not see when we were still together. It&rsquo;s like we were blinded. It&rsquo;s like the power of reason had somehow disintegrated. All the plans and promises go down the drain. Sometimes, it tempts us to go back: Just seeing how fruitful the future could have been. Be alone for a while. Better yourself and grow again. Rise and take your mantle. It&rsquo;s only then that your happiness will regenerate.
Do not be too fast to move on. We want to get over our pan so fast we forget how long we build and triumphed for our union. You look for a rebound, mess yourself up countless times and before you even open your eyes you realize you&rsquo;re still in the wilderness. You learn that a pig is just a pig. You go back to your old self and drink your sorrows away. Those nasty suicidal thoughts slowly creep in smiling at your silly cupcake like face and before you even realize, you are back to your pills. Don&rsquo;t settle for someone mediocre just because you were not patient enough to wait.
In any case, if you fought till the very end to keep it alive, even when sometimes you thought you guys will never get through this battlefield you should be hell proud of yourself. If there was no compassion, sacrifice and commitment; it wasn&rsquo;t love then."
688,"Having a boyfriend is obviously awesome but having a male best friend with nothing more than just a purely platonic relationship is undeniably fantastic in its own feels. Where its not your smile, that hell of a beautifull innocent cupcake like face nor that eight hour glass body that interests him. Its you...just you even with those old fashioned grandmother clothes or when youre having a bad hair day. Your relationship has this kind of unmeasurable depth because it totally has nothing to do with your appearance or physical attraction.
You can laugh so bad or cry so hard and not care less what he will think of you. You can do hell lots of gross stuff together and not care what in hades the world thinks. With this understanding of mutual attraction, you are not even worried that your male bestie will dump you if you stupidly annoy him. Its a free world where insecurities are null and void. All you have is deeply unspoken relation; not even of blood but a bold steel willing to walk in that whole shit.
You already have ton of things in common. Theres no old Methusellah like conversations like, ""hey, how are you doing?"" its just so lame. The other day my male bestie was like ,"" Hey, im coming over with my spiderman thing. Make sure you hold on tight coz tonight we'll be flying real high"". I mean...you can literally say anything with your bestie without attaching anything to it and the feeling is damn so amazing. When you know you can say absolutely anything without being judged, no ill feelings is a major.
Besties have no luxury to end up things no matter how tough the going gets. You always find away to make things work again even if its bringing her a sachet of coffee that him and his roomates parted with in their budget to buy. You dont have to feign interest in things you hate to impress him like how you pretend to hear reggae or blues or bongo when you are with your boyfriend coz you would not want to hurt his ""feelings"". No matter how much your boyfriend loves you with a fake confession; to death, his focus on you will always at some point, fall back when the hill gets steeper and the climb is just too drainning to take another step. Male besties listen. In the dead of the night theyll be there. They will think out with you without getting mad. They will see a thousand pictures of the opposite sex in your amazingly coded gallery and they wont conclude. Your guy bestie is one of the handfull people in the planet youd totally embarass yourself for!
Even though your male besties may be a consistent audience for your ""blue"" material, sometimes, feelings get in the way. My best friends bestie confessed weeks ago that he had developed sexual feelings for her. When it reaches this point , when this guy ""bestie"" wants to cross this bridge youve not even been seeing this whole time, things never remain the same. Its not like its so wrong but it messes up everything. What if everything never gets to how it was back then?
Suspicions come in, ego comes in too. You start being concious of your self around him. Many times, it all ends up in dissapointment.

689,"The recently concluded Superbowl 53 was definitely the most boring sporting event i've ever witnessed. However this game gave me and every other Arsenal fan so much joy!.... why? ..... because Big Stan lost!. It would have been a downright travesty to witness this man achieving such a massive victory after the way my beloved Arsenal has been treated.
Arsenal FC can be best described as the side-chick who always hangs onto the hope that she will one day be the centre of attention. Arsenal fans embrace the start of each transfer window with giddiness and frenzy at te height of things. The newspaper backpages link us with Cavani, Bale, Martial and so many other superstars. We start to dream about what could be, the hardcore fans start conjuring up formations and tactics based on the talent that we hope will join us. However August arrives and its the same old story, we sell more talent than what we bring in and return a profit!!!!. How on earth can a team who wants to challenge for honors return a profit after the transfer window?! like come on!.
The highlight of this is the Luis Suarez saga where we offered &pound;40m plus a whole pound ... yes you heard that right, Liverpool asked for &pound;40m and we offered &pound;40,000,001 ... at this point its borderline torture because it was clear they had no desire to sign the player.
Looking across the pond its a whole different ball game. Big Stan took the Rams franchise away from its founding city (who knows he may move Arsenal FC to Wales if the money is right). So the people of St Louis are clearly not big fans of him.... this is where the similarities end though. Stan is reportedly spending $1.6 billion (a.k.a 6 Neymars) on a new stadium project that he is funding himself. So he's clearly not lacking cash, and this is the reason behind my categorisation of what Arsenal means to the man, we are just the side-attraction that he throws some bones to when he's bored... but we will never be top priority... the dreams of being like Manchester City and spending &pound;300m in a transfer window, or like our bitter rivals Manchester United and spending &pound;100m on a single player will most likely never come to pass.
However superbowl 53 at least gave him a glimpse into the disappointment that is now a permanent fixture in the life of an Arsenal fan. We can only hope for the day when he liquidates his shares and sells the club to someone who's actually passionate about football."
690,"This is the story of how I took a ""trip"" in one of these bad boys (pictured above), definitely my best automotive experience to date. There are some experiences that are truly priceless, and this was one of them. Pretty sure there's no groupon deal for this one!..... its your standard tuesday in Lagos where i'm on holiday visiting my parents. Whilst i'm there I decided to renew my american visa and on this faithful day i'm heading over to the embassy with my brother to get said visa. It's unbelievably hot and humid, especially for one coming from the west so i'm dressed for comfort (you know those days where you throw some random stuff on and hope you dont run into anyone)... we're talking flips flops, scruffy jeans and your ""stay at home"" t-shirt.
I'm standing in line to get through security when I suddenly hear a lot of commotion around me, this was pre Boko-Haram so I genuinely wasn't fussed, spurious commotion is part and parcel of Lagos life. I turn around and see the police grabbing a bunch of people (visa touts) and bundling them into the police truck and driving away. What's a visa tout you say? well these are walking cyber centres, need a document photocopied? ...done!, need a passport photograph for your visa application? ... done!. So i'm minding my business chatting with my brother, remember I'M FROM LONDON so of course there is no way I could ever be mistaken for being a visa tout .... oh how wrong I was! (i conveniently forgot the fact that I'm shabbily dressed).
Someone suddenly grabs my arm and says 'Oya follow me, I don catch you today''... translation ... ""TROUBLE!"". I was about to object and educate him on the fact that I'M FROM LONDON but I saw the gun pointed in my direction and realised that I had made no plans to die when I left the house that morning. Next thing I know, my brother and I are bundled onto the pickup truck with a bunch of OT's (Original Touts) and were headed to the police station. It was a truly amazing drive from the embassy in Victoria Island down to the police station, the cool breeze flowing, scenic route with a spectacular view of the waterside, and then other motorists giving you judgemental looks because you are a ""criminal"" on the back of a police truck, did I care.... nope... why?.... I'M FROM LONDON!.
We get to the station and are made to sit on the floor, within me i'm like ""damn this is the REAL experience"". My brother decides to educate the police officers that HE'S FROM LONDON and ""this behaviour is unacceptable"". Suddenly right in front of us we see a slap from the pits of hell decend on one of the OT's next to us KAPLOW!!!. I turn over to my bro and give him that look that says ""keep this sh*t up and you're next"". I'm now sitting there wondering how this man's heart did not pack up and call it a day after such trauma, my heart was beating pretty fast and I wasnt even involved!.
Eventually, after about 2-3 hours we get an audience with our captors and explain that WE ARE FROM LONDON and subsequently regain our freedom without a hint of remorse or apology from the police who wrongfully arrested us. If this was the UK I would have been looking forward to that big fat check that would come out after the impending lawsuit. To add insult to injury, as we are walking out, one of the officers comes up to us and says ""Oga anything for the boys"" ... translation .... ""I have absolutely no shame, and actually have the audacity to ask you for money even after wrongfully arresting you and wasting your time"". My response? ..... I dip my hands into my pocket... get some notes out and hand it over to him... why? ... because I'M FROM LONDON."
691,"We are acquainted with the saying that if you want to be happy in life, do what you love. What we might not be aware of is that there is the second part of this phrase which says, love what you do.
It goes without arguing that some of the most successful people in life are the ones who were bold enough to pursue that which they love. After all, the likes of Paulo Coelho, Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, Walt Disney, and many more proved that it is by doing what you love that you find fantastic success. All these are people who will convince you that you should refrain from following the market and instead follow your passion. However, the reality is that doing what you love alone will not make you successful &ndash; it takes more than just doing what you love.
After being employed for several years, I decided that it was high time to quit the 9 to 5 system of work and do what I love. Do I regret it? No, I don&rsquo;t, and just like the mentioned names, I am a big advocate for pursuing your talent. It has been three years since I quit my office work and ventured into writing, which is pretty much what I love. However, through the years I learned the lesson I was never told, or I never knew before becoming rebellious the hard way. It isn&rsquo;t about doing what you love but having the right skills for what you love.
In my years as a writer, I have worked with people who often believe that to become a writer all you need to do is have the need to write, know where to put the words, the right verbs, and how to format your paper correctly. In my first year, I belonged to this category, and what made it worse, is the fact that I was writing under someone who was pretty much like me &ndash; with no desire to be better. It was one year later when I almost gave up on my passion after I felt stale and started realizing that I had no value that someone showed me the reality of writing.
Writing is not a matter of creativity; for talent without the right skills is useless.
In her article, You&rsquo;re Not Meant to Do What You Love, Brianna West mentioned that &ldquo;you&rsquo;re meant to do what you&rsquo;re good at.&rdquo; This is the truth that many of you are never told before venturing out and following your passion &ndash; you need to be great if not good at what you love.
Therefore, what then do you need to do to pursue your passion? It is simple &ndash; acquire the right skills which will equip you with the hands-on knowledge. Instead of just doing what you love, you need to know what you love in and out. It takes two processes to achieve this; you must constantly practice what you love, and you must learn about what you love.
I have often been told that the secret to becoming a better writer is by reading and writing a lot. This applies to every career or passion that you want to pursue and it is this concept that makes up the second part of doing what you love. With knowledge and skills, you will slowly find yourself loving what you do.
Yes, you can do what you love, and make a living from it (I&rsquo;m not refuting this), but you need to understand that the market today is very competitive and consumers want value for their time and money. Therefore, to be the best in what you love and be guaranteed to have the success you desire, do what Steve Martin said &ndash; be so good that they can&rsquo;t ignore you. And the only way you&rsquo;re going to be this good is by having the skills which compliment what you love.
Remember doing what you love is still work, and you will only find that fulfillment when you sharpen your talent with the right tools. Even those who are already successful by following this path spent days and years gaining skills and learning about what they love."
692,"Recently in my quest to understand the evolution of man, I luckily stumbled upon a document that not only shed light to one of the most significant issues I have been battling but also to a concept that made me believe we are living in a century witnessing the rise of lack of intelligence. Maybe that's a strong word to use in this context but bear with me before you martyr this post.
Back in 2008, Nicholas Carr, the author behind the book The Shallows and The Glass Cage: Automation and Us posted an article in The Atlantic titled Is Google Making Us Stupid?. In the article, the author expresses how the rise of technology has gradually made us stupid regardless of the fact that it put us in the middle of an endless universe of information. I was very skeptical when I started reading the post until Carr hinted to how this too much information indeed makes us all less wise.
Whenever my friends and I have conversations about the wonders of technology, almost always, you will hear one person referring to us as the lucky generation. The reason behind this bravado is a simple fact that we were born in the 80s, grew up in the 90s, and lived in the new century. All these are periods characterized by significant changes in technology &ndash; simply put, we lived before the internet, during the infancy of the internet, and even witnessed internet peak past its puberty into its AI-dulthood. And the naked truth is that it is not only the society that has evolved but also the human mind.
Growing up as an introverted introvert, I often looked at books as the best way that I could spend my time. I would devote uninterrupted hours just reading; but as I grew up and finally afforded to buy my first android phone, I realized that I gradually lost this verve of reading. At first, I readily blamed it on my busy schedule, then with time, it came clear that even when I was free, it was easy for me to distract myself with what's new on WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Tumblr, Goodreads, and Google. Aren&rsquo;t we all either way?
The advent of Google was nascent of the modern man &ndash; the one empowered with all the information at his fingertips. Many people have argued that Google has made us all wiser than the previous generation. This is a statement I rebut regardless of the majority who believe otherwise. Google, instead, has only made information easily accessible for everyone.
Every day we fill our minds with immeasurable information because we are always reading something, either a message, a favorite blog post, an eBook, a scholarly article or watching YouTube videos. This constant supply of knowledge is perilous because it is always highly likely that we are doing two activities at the same time. In turn, this chips away the mind's ability to concentrate on one thing. In my case, when I am in the middle of reading a book, I would quickly find myself thinking about something else which would force me to stop whatever I was doing, almost instantly &ndash; a behavior I never had before. It didn't take me long before I realized that I couldn't concentrate on one thing for two hours before my mind reaches the hungry point.
What we have done is we have altered the brain activity process. While in the 90s I would occupy an entire afternoon just reading a book, nowadays I cannot even go past one hour without needing to check my phone or Google up the meaning of a word I did not understand.
As I tried to understand whether this is an age-related condition, I found a 2013 article Is technology and the internet reducing pupils' attention spans? by Duncan Jeffries which mentioned that a survey by Pew Research Center showed while 77% of American teachers stated that internet has a positive impact on students, 87% of the 2500 teachers agreed that technology had created an easily distracted generation with short attention spans. This is destructive because it means that we no longer give our minds time to process the exuberant information that we feed it. How many times have you found yourself trying to remember something that you read early in the morning or previous day? Yes, this is the effect of continually feeding your brain. It dilutes every information that you pick because as long as the brain is unable to process what you feed it, it will replace the old materials with the new knowledge that you give it.
Yes reading exercises the brain, but this is only successful if you give your mind time to digest this information. Otherwise, we are nothing but a generation carrying our brains in our pockets.
So yes, this is a generation that has encouraged the loss of knowledge through too much reading which ironically supports the decrease in human intelligence. As Plato once feared in Phaedrus, receiving a vast amount of information will make people believe that they are knowledgeable without realizing for the most part they are ignorant. This is because they are filled with false wisdom due to lack of exercising the memory. Though my point somehow coincides with Nicholas Carr&rsquo;s argument, I mainly believe that Google and internet are not the problems, but the overreliance we've developed towards these two essentials of the 21st century."
693,"Popular Nigerian singer, Mc Galaxy has reacted to the backlash following alleged video of him asking girls to reveal their bodies for N50,000.
The singer came under intense attack online on Sunday after an Instagram video of him asking ladies to strip naked for N50,000 went viral.
In the viral live Instagram video which has since stirred reactions from celebrities and Nigerians, a girl was seen dancing naked to one of his songs.
Actress Toyin Abraham on Sunday attacked Galaxy for asking girls to reveal their bodies for the sum of N50,000, adding that such post promotes negative notion about women.
On her Instagram page, she wrote: &ldquo;Dear MC Galaxy, what you did asking girls to go naked for 50k is despicable, debasing, and bad in every way.
&ldquo;You just further strengthen the believe that the easiest way women can get things is to sell their bodies. I sincerely can&rsquo;t fathom what you need or gain from this despicable act when you could have checked in on porn sites.&rdquo;
But, reacting, Mc Galaxy on Monday denied asking anyone to strip naked for N50,000.
He defended himself, explaining that it was his friend that promised to give a lady who called and stripped naked for him N50,000 while on Instagram live.
&ldquo;On Friday night live, I held an IG live session where fans called in to show their talent. some rapped, sang and some danced. We got calls from everywhere both guys and ladies called in to showcase their talent.
&ldquo;At some point, a particular lady called in with her clothes on. I actually dropped her off but the fans from the comments insisted I accept her request, so I did.
&ldquo;As she danced, a friend declared her the winner and promised to give her 50,000naira to dance naked. There was no price tag for anybody to go naked. This issue was a case of Instagram live that went out of hand.
&ldquo;If you follow my page, you would know that I have the utmost respect for women. I have helped a lot of my female followers, ladies who without asking anything in return and without informing anyone. My apologies; we will handle things better next time,&rdquo; Galaxy explained."

697,"Popular Nigerian entertainer, Iyanya Mbuk, has said that Ubi Franklin, his former business partner and CEO of Made Man Music Group (MMMG), forged his signature in a settlement document when he left the record label.
In an interview with Nnadi TV, Mbuk said it was upon his exit that he discovered that his name was not on any of the forms for establishing the company.
According to him, &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t like to talk about all this stuff but I also feel like sometimes you have to clear the air and it&rsquo;s a good thing that you&rsquo;re asking this. When I say there was darkness, I was not myself anymore because I felt like there was no trust anymore,&rdquo; he told Bolanle Olukanni, the host.
&ldquo;At the time I thought I co-owned Made Men with Ubi but I later realized that my name was not on any of the forms&hellip; That was the beginning of me just saying to hell with everything.&rdquo; he said.
Responding to the claim, Franklin took to his Instagram page to show pictures of a settlement agreement document with Iyanya. The documents included Iyanya&rsquo;s signature, while indicating a sum of N200,000 paid to the musician.
Iyanya, who came into fame after winning the first season of MTN Project Fame, denied knowledge of the documents in an interview with Daddy Freeze, an on-air-personality with Cool FM.
He insisted he only found out years later that he was not included as a co-director of the record label, though he had signed an incorporation form, which was not submitted by Franklin.
He said &ldquo;Franklin posted a settlement agreement that we had in 2016. If you want to prove your innocence, why don&rsquo;t you post the incorporation certificate of the company when you first registered in 2012&hellip; Ok everybody ask yourself this question before you have to settle an agreement, what happened? We don&rsquo;t just wake up and say, let us settle an agreement,&rdquo;.
&ldquo;He had already brought a CAC form to me before when I signed that paper, he left my room. And a couple of years later, I keep going around telling people I co-owned this thing. I took a flight to Abuja and I didn&rsquo;t tell anybody, and I requested for it (CAC form). Bro, the day I got that form from them guys from CAC, it changed my whole life"" he added.
speaking further, he said &ldquo;I found the same form I filled but my name was not there as a director. It was Ubi&rsquo;s brother name that was there. I took a picture I did everything, I confronted him, this guy begged me, he apologized to me&hellip;The same person is coming out now to put whatever he is posting, to lie again&hellip; that&rsquo;s why it is shocking.&rdquo;
Iyanya said he is set to debut a record label, &lsquo;Violet 360&rsquo;, with Alexander Okunsaya for his new single titled, &lsquo;No Drama&rsquo;."

According to him, &ldquo;A lot of artistes make records but that&rsquo;s not really who they are. I know lots of rappers that sing and singers that want to make rap songs"".

Speaking further, he said &ldquo;What I thought was to create a platform where artistes come and are themselves, a platform where they can produce and I&rsquo;m so excited that the whole idea worked. &ldquo;Though all that has changed right now and it&rsquo;s now a hundred percent big names on the list, that wasn&rsquo;t the essence of it in the first place.&rdquo;

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re becoming a country that laughs at everything.

Freedom of minds, agency over our bodies, and equity for all is not a choice. It&rsquo;s the only way.
&ldquo;Youth culture, as we interpret it, does not subscribe to the idea that those who are participants are young in their stage of life. This list of women&mdash;carefully curated from over 500 nominations&mdash;is one that spans over two generations of changemakers and is not beholden to age.

While the film industry was busy awardingGreen Bookas the best movie of the last year, Hart was busy at home, watching television with his kid. He posted a picture of the pair on his Instagram account with the hashtag #Harts and #DopePic. Later he posted a video of him working out.
It&rsquo;s not surprising that Hart decided to skip the Oscars this year. He was all set to host the show a few months ago until old and offensive tweets of his resurfaced. The online backlash forced him to give up the gig. When Ellen DeGeneres pressured the Academy to reconsider, Hart almost came back, but ultimately decided to stay away.
The controversy didn&rsquo;t end up ruining the awards show, which ran on schedule for the first time in years. Ratings were even up from last year, which were the least watched Oscars in history. Maybe Hart will get another shot in 2020. His filmThe Upsideis already one of the first big hits of 2019, andJumanji 3is scheduled for release this December, proving his star is as bright as ever."

704,"Nigerian singer and photographer, TY Bello, has become the latest celebrity to recount how she was sexually abused.
A lot of popular faces have found strength to talk about their past, since Timi Dakolo&rsquo;s wife, Busola, came out toaccuse Biodun Fatoyinbo, the senior pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) of raping her as a teenager.
Although Fatoyinbo denied the allegation, the pastor has been widely criticised, with some Nigerians on Twitter asking him to step down &mdash; which he &ldquo;honourably&rdquo; did.
TY Bello took to Instagram to break her silence about being sexually abused at a younger age. She also narrated how God rescued her years after.
&ldquo;I remember how the silence I had to keep after the abuse slowly killed me .. I also remember the relief I found in my relationship God so early.
&ldquo;That really was my rescue ..yet for decades I could never find my voice on the matter .. I was still afraid ..Mostly because I felt it may have been the fault of my seven-year-old self .. somehow&hellip; Fast forward .. almost thirty years later ..I knew better .. and was &lsquo;big&rsquo; enough..
&ldquo;I understood the importance of stepping up when it was time to share my story .. and ..I did in my @kemiadetiba &lsquo;s #kingwomen interview .. it surprised me, however, how hard it was to talk about sexual abuse after so many years .. but it was such a relief ..But soon after came the resistance.
&ldquo;In sharing ..I faintly began tasting the shame again .. that same feeling of naked &lsquo;dirtiness &lsquo;&rsquo; I had as a child .. it hadn&rsquo;t completely gone away. It also became clear .. that real stories of sexual abuse still sounded like NOVELTY.. I saw headline after headline .. even in broken English .. this my &lsquo;confession &lsquo;.that &lsquo; Dem &lsquo;SPOIL &lsquo; me when I be small pikin&rsquo;..
&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t feel good that it was so &lsquo;sensational&rsquo; as I was aware of how massive a plague this was ..WE CLEARLY ARE NOT TALKING ENOUGH ..too many children sexually abused .. too many sex crimes ..especially now .. right under our noses.
&ldquo;I had to push past the inner conflict that talking about it was &lsquo;unnecessary&rsquo; &hellip; it was too long ago ..too &lsquo;Oyinboish &lsquo;to discuss publicly .. &lsquo;. &lsquo;Then of course ..that talking about it now would make it seem like my family failed me as a child .. but they didn&rsquo;t .. and could never have known .. I had mastered SILENCE !they were victims too.
&ldquo;Every abuse story is different but it is SHAME that makes them complicated..
&ldquo;Sadly, the shame hardly lies with the perpetrators .. So I&rsquo;ve learnt that it&rsquo;s time to nail shame right where it belongs ..Far away from the wronged .. Bringing them instead to healing, justice and freedom.
&ldquo;We must teach every child the power of their voices, Apparently, we must teach adults too &hellip; and more importantly, we must learn to listen .. understand and know that Sex is not a dirty word .. but DENIAL is ..&rdquo; she wrote."
705,"Nathaniel Bassey, popular Nigerian gospel musician and trumpeter, has weighed in on the ongoing rape saga involving the Senior Pastor of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, COZA, Biodun Fatoyinbo.
Bassey said the current rape saga was an indication that God was cleansing the church.
Recall that wife of popular musician, Timi Dakolo, Busola, had alleged that the COZA founder forcefully raped her when she was young.
The mother-of-three narrated how PastorFatoyinbo allegedly forced his way into her when she was a teenager.
Fatoyinbo, who denied the allegation, however, admitted that Busola once attended the same church with his family.
The clergyman consequentlyordered his lawyers to institute both criminal and civil cases against Busola.
Reacting to the saga, Bassey in an Instagram post wrote: &ldquo;Thanks for joining the Live session. Highlights
&ldquo;1. Even in this turbulent times. God is purging His church. And things that can be shaken are shaken.
&ldquo;2. The care to not react, but respond after careful consideration. And the importance of following the word.

706,"Controversial On Air Personality, Daddy Freeze has said he is raising his daughters to see themselves as equal to men. Freeze also said that if any of his daughters hit a man first, he doesn't expect them to come back crying to him if he retaliates.
He made this known via his Instagram page on Thursday, March 14, 2019.
According to him, ""I raise my daughters to consider themselves equal to men in privileges, opportunities, and rights. If my daughter should slap a man, she CAN never come crying to me, claiming that she was slapped by a man, if she slapped the man first. As long as what the man gives her is in equal measure to what she gave him, I won&rsquo;t take her side. This is how I raise my daughters. ~FRZ,""he wrote.
Freeze's comments are coming just a few days after a video of a woman hitting a man which led to a fight between them went viral.
The OAP is best known for his controversial statements on any social or trending topic. We can't forget in a hurry how he came hard on majority of Nigerian men after Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos' divorce scandal broke the Internet.
In a post via his Instagram page on Monday, January 14, 2019, he talked about cheating in relationships and how he thinks most Nigerian men are like Jeff Bezoswho is caught in a divorce scandal.
""In my opinion, 90 percent of Nigerian men are like Jeff Bezos. The only problem is they pray a lot more and earn substantially less. Many of the married women bashing Bezos, including wives of pastors, are probably being cheated upon right now as we speak. The sad thing is that if their husbands leave them, most won&rsquo;t smell 140,000 naira let alone half of a $140 billion fortune.
""Some of you husbands forming holy holy. I&rsquo;m fasting for 40days with my &lsquo;G&rsquo; Hoe while your wives and girlfriends are enjoying the taste of #Asiwaju, God himself will expose you all.🤮🤢 I NEVER support cheating in a relationship and I don&rsquo;t cheat, but worse than cheating is hypocrisy, I have zero tolerance for that. So, if your husband has never cheated on you, or you have never cheated on your wife before, feel free to cast the first stone at Bezos, if not, please do the world a favor and STFU! ~FRZ#FreeTheSheeple,""he wrote.

707,"Nollywood comic actor, John Okafor widely known as Mr. Ibu, has narrated how he was brought back to life by God after he was killed by unknown men.
Mr. Ibu said he would not have been alive to tell his story if not for God who gave him a second chance to live.
Ibu was reported to be down with a stroke recently but the comic made a video to debunk the report, however, the story was not far from the truth.
The 57-year-old said he was attacked and hypnotized while he was in Nnewi, Anambra State to grace an occasion organized by one of the big shots in the town in December last year.
The actor narrated the incident for the first time in an interview with Vanguard as saying, &ldquo;All the stories flying around; the issue of stroke among others are funny to me. This is because the original problem I had was on the 24th of December last year.
He said &ldquo;An Nnewi-based business mogul, Ebube Chukwu Uzo, had invited me to come and perform at his party. I was in London when he contacted me on the telephone.
&ldquo;I promised him that I would be back soon. So, I left London for Lagos on the 19th of December. I made a brief stopover in Ivory Coast where I spent few a days before returning to the country on the 22 December.
&ldquo;On the morning of 24 December, I flew into Enugu to assemble my dancers and artistes before heading to Nnewi by road.
&ldquo;When we landed Nnewi, I never knew that the people who had been in touch with me all this while were the enemies of my host. They were busy diverting my movement out of the appropriate place.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And before I knew what was happening, I found myself in a hotel they claimed to have booked for me. While I was waiting for them there, I went to a quiet place to avoid creating a scene. I kept communicating with them until they arrived at the hotel.
&ldquo;My P.A was the only person who was with me at that moment.
&ldquo;But few minutes after he went downstairs to buy soft drink (because he said he was thirsty) two men dressed in white clothes walked up to me and immediately, I suspected they were the people I was waiting for.
&ldquo;I stood up because I was lying down when they arrived. I looked at their faces and saw them smiling at me. I said to them &lsquo;where are we heading to?&rsquo; Nobody replied me.
&ldquo;I said okay, if you are my fans there&rsquo;s no problem. Before I could finish speaking, a big blow landed on my nose and mouth. I passed out immediately, and later my lifeless body was lying on the floor while my spirit was hanging in the air.
&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t standing on anything neither was I holding anything. I was seeing what the two men were doing to my body but they were not seeing me. I was surprised they were not seeing me where I was standing. My spirit was seeing them.&rdquo; Ibu meant that his physical body was lying lifeless on the ground but his spirit was seeing them as he had left his body.
&ldquo;They succeeded in putting life out of that body before they left the place. Meanwhile, one of the cleaners in the hotel saw what happened to me and raised an alarm before my P.A and other sympathizers rushed down to the place where my lifeless body was lying on the ground.
&ldquo;They tried to revive me but to no avail. I was hearing what they were discussing, but they couldn&rsquo;t see me. At a point, the owner of the hotel suggested that they should take my corpse to the mortuary but my boys refused.
&ldquo;The following day, which was 25th of December, they moved my body to a nearby hospital in Nnewi where the doctor on duty confirmed me dead and advised my boys to deposit my corpse into the mortuary.&rdquo; &ldquo;My boys refused to adhere to the doctor&rsquo;s advice.
&ldquo;They moved my lifeless body to Enugu on the 26th of December. When we reached Enugu, they took me to one herbal hospital and the first doctor that examined my body confirmed that there was no life in me any longer.
&ldquo;My boys did not give up. On 28 December after the doctors couldn&rsquo;t revive me, while in the spiritual realm, a face like a masquerade was revealed and was smiling at me.
&ldquo;It later disappeared before two hands appeared from the blue and commanded me to go back. Immediately, I woke up , and everybody took to their heels. When I woke up I could neither walk nor talk again.
&ldquo;It was obvious that something happened to me. On the 30th of December, my wife arrived Enugu and when she saw me she started crying, while I was laughing. At a point, she started playing with me. She held my hand and was teaching me how to walk again.
&ldquo;Soon, I started regaining my senses. On the 30th of December I finally regained full consciousness. I asked my wife what we were doing in Enugu. I said to her, &lsquo;I told you I was going to Nnewi; how come we ended up in Enugu?&rsquo;
&ldquo;My wife told me to calm down; that she was going to tell me everything that happened along the line. And when I regained full consciousness she narrated everything that happened to me. I was dumbfounded.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I came back to my senses. After I was discharged from the hospital the man that invited me to Nnewi managed to send my flight ticket back to Lagos with that of my wife.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I returned to Lagos alive, and since then nobody has called me to inquire about my condition of health.
&ldquo;But I thank God that the will of my enemies did not prevail against my life.
&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t kill me because God knows I didn&rsquo;t offend anybody,&rdquo; he added."

Daddy Freeze who took to his Twitterhandle recently to state that all vows are satanic, including the ones made on wedding day; added that Christ said so himself.
He wrote: &ldquo;For Christians, the scriptures say two became one. How can you become one with someone who can&rsquo;t access your phone, email or bank details? HOW?
&ldquo;Those pulpit gaslights have lied to you all your life, a great pity it is that you are living a lie and the consequence is your expulsion from God&rsquo;s city read Rev22:15.
&ldquo;Many of you are living separate lives while carrying a legal document to pronounce you a couple. That&rsquo;s a huge joke on no one else but you.
&ldquo;The fact that you got married in a religious shrine in front of a priest does not make you a married couple, as a matter of fact, you don&rsquo;t need a priest or a church to get married.
&ldquo;1 Peter2:5 says we are all priests, stop outsourcing your priestly role to a yahoo boy by hiring someone else to do your job, pronounce YOURSELF married, IT&rsquo;S YOUR GOD GIVEN DUTY and it has NOTHING to do with the church.
&ldquo;All vows are satanic, including marriage vows, Christ said so himself, when you see him, argue with him.
&ldquo;Become one with your spouse today, or get a divorce, it&rsquo;s as simple as that, stop leading another person into lust because of Godless religious traditions. ~FRZ&rdquo;
Reacting to this, the Church of Satan took the to its verified Twitter handle to express disagreement with Daddy Freeze, saying they find his views contrary to their belief in Satan,
The church wrote: &ldquo;Marriage is not for everyone, but Satanists can admit and take responsibility for their own positions.
&ldquo;Sounds like Daddy Freeze is just trying to make excuses to get out of it (making marriage vows).&rdquo;

&ldquo;But if you go to Nigeria you have Wizkid, Davido, P-square driving Bentley, Mercedes Benz they actually own those cars. That&rsquo;s the difference but if we don&rsquo;t translate that, they would never know.
&ldquo;The images they show about Africa are so negative. It&rsquo;s conditioning what we believe. Africa has a rich story too. More people died in Chicago, more school shootings in America.&rdquo;"

Fosudo made this statement on Saturday in Lagos during his presentation at a capacity building workshop for members of staff of the National Film and Video Censors&rsquo; Board (NFVCB) south-west zone.
The event with the theme, &lsquo;Film and Video Works in the New Horizon&rsquo;, had in attendance stakeholders from the academia as well as seasoned industry practitioners who held training sessions for participants.
Fosudo spoke on &lsquo;General Principles and Criteria for Film Classification&rsquo; at the event.
&ldquo;The violence scenes in our films today have become more gruesome and sex scenes have become increasingly detailed,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Use of vulgar language on screen has also increased over the years along with disregard for moral values, family values and religious tolerance.
&ldquo;We rarely get to watch movies that are purely serene and meaningful and lacking violence and obscenity.
&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s generation would consider such movies of those days to be lame or boring because they are so used to seeing and hearing the violent and the obscene.&rdquo;
He said that the moral decadence and increased aggressive behaviour among juvenile were largely traceable to films they watch.
He, therefore, urged filmmakers to place societal values, culture and national interest above personal pecuniary interests.
The professor of Theatre Arts, however, commended NFVCB for its role in steering the nation&rsquo;s evolving motion picture industry.
He urged the board to be more stringent in handling filmmakers who breach its classification guidelines.
&ldquo;Extensive research has shown that higher levels of children&rsquo;s exposure to media violence correlate with increased acceptance of aggressive attitudes and increased aggressive behaviour.
&ldquo;Hence, there is a need for proper and diligent classification of our films in order to protect the young and the vulnerable in our society.&rdquo;"

@Apt &ldquo;Davido really said &ldquo;nobody holy&rdquo; on Naira Marley&rsquo;s comment on yahoo boys,Sigh! His statement is a double edged sword.Whatever he meant still interprets negative.&rdquo;
@_Harrisonjnr &ldquo;This Naira Marley topic just proved my pending doubt that Davido is really a yahoo boy.&rdquo;
@Flosode &ldquo;Davido or The Marley guy won&rsquo;t say the same things about yahoo if they or their parents were the victims of yahoo.&rdquo;
@Ibitoye_Phillipo &ldquo;Many won&rsquo;t agree but religion is one of our biggest problems in Nigeria. The way we practice it. Davido&rsquo;s pathetic &ldquo;Nobody holy pass&rdquo; comment on Naira Marley&rsquo;s post glorifying fraud is a perfect example. We put religion ahead of simple morals.If morals were a priority, there would be no stupid talks of &lsquo;holiness&rsquo; in such situations, it would just be purely about what is right and what is wrong.&rdquo;
@RoyalPriest1 &ldquo;In a country where things works, people like the so called Naira Marley, Davido etc would have been on watch list but EFCC is as guilty and impotent.&rdquo;
@Ologunkutere &ldquo;Davido, spitting his usual stupidity, high bred class stupidity at that! Zlatan and Naira Marley displaying the low life mentality that have being their hallmarks. Big reminder that music and sense doesn&rsquo;t equate!
@AyoShonaiya &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this &ldquo;no one is holy&rdquo; reference. Is that what people say to themselves when they commit crimes.Committing a crime is down to you and you only. Has nothing to do with whether nobody is holy.&rdquo;

750,"controversial on-air personality, Daddy Freeze, has reacted to Pastor Victor Eghan&rsquo;s comments, asking Christians to stop watching &lsquo;Game of Thrones&rsquo;, a popular TV series.
Eghan, who is Ghanaian, had warned Christians who watch &lsquo;Games of Thrones&rsquo;, that they are at &ldquo;risk of going to hell&rdquo;.
Writing on his Facebook page, the cleric claimed that some of the things on display in the series are immoral and against the doctrines of the Bible.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re so attached to Game of Thrones that you&rsquo;re getting angry with me, then who are you worshipping? GOD or GOT? One letter makes a big difference. And that one letter change can make a big difference when you stand before GOD on that day,&rdquo; Eghan wrote.
In his reaction, Freeze said it was hypocritical of the pastor to have made such a statement.
&ldquo;Dear Pastor, it is absolutely un-scholarly and downright hypocritical to tell people to stop watching `Game of Thrones` without telling them to also stop reading the Bible, because there is hardly any difference between the story lines of both.
&ldquo;Game of Thrones had 865 deaths, the Bible had more than two million; David killed 200 men and cut their foreskins just to marry Saul&rsquo;s daughter.
&ldquo;Game of Thrones had 17 rape cases; the Bible also had many:David&rsquo;s daughter Tamar was raped by her own brother Amnon.
&ldquo;Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah, was also raped and her brothers committed murder in their revenge.
&ldquo;While many scholars suggest that David himself raped Bathsheba, Solomon&rsquo;s mother; Solomon also murdered his own brother Adonijah because of a girl called Abishag.
&ldquo;Game of Thrones had 144 scenes of naked people.
&ldquo;The Bible also has a major scene; David dancing almost naked in front of the whole city, while Christ himself was stripped naked publicly and beaten before being crucified.&rsquo;&rsquo;
&ldquo;You say there are prostitutes in game of thrones. Aren&rsquo;t Christ, David and Solomon all descendants of a prostitute named Rahab?
&ldquo;Therefore, this submission is ignorant and does very little to showcase anything apart from your ignorance of the scriptures,&rdquo; Freeze commented on Instagram."

YouTube singer Austin Jones has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for asking underage girls to send him sexually explicit videos of themselves to prove that they're fans.

Jones, 26, crooned a capella covers of popular songs andperformed on tournationwide. Most of the fans of the suburban Chicago singer were teenage girls.


In 2017, he was arrested on two counts of production of child pornography. Jones admitted to enticing six underage girls to make pornographic videos of themselves and send them to him, according toa plea agreement. The girls were as young as 14.

He pleaded guilty in February, and on Friday, US. District Judge John Z. Lee sentenced him to 10 years in federal prison.

""Production and receipt of child pornography are extraordinarily serious offenses that threaten the safety of our children and communities,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine Neff Welsh said in the government's sentencing memorandum.

""Jones' actions took something from his victims and their families that they will never be able to get back.""


To get the videos, Jones told some of the girls ""to 'prove' they were his biggest fans,"" that they ""were part of a modeling opportunity, and that he could assist them in gaining followers on Instagram,"" the Department of Justice said.

Jones admitted using Facebook to persuade minor girls to send him pornographic videos and pictures approximately 30 other times.

He messaged girls as young as 14



Even before his arrest, Jones had come under fire for his interactions with young fans. In June 2015, he posted a16-minute YouTube videoin which he looked directly into the camera and admitted that he used to ask fans to send him twerking videos.

""Nothing ever went further than twerking videos,"" he said. ""There were never any nudes, never any physical contact.""

Jones was first arrested in June 2017 at O'Hare International Airport and questioned in a recorded interview, the complaint states. He waived his Miranda rights and admitted to using Facebook to have sexually explicit chats with underage girls, receive explicit videos from them and view those videos for sexual pleasure.

He instructed them on what to say

A federal criminal complaint cites two instances of Jones messaging teenage girls to send him explicit videos of themselves dancing.

In one example, Jones messaged with a girl who told him she was 14 years old. Jones allegedly asked her to send videos of herself dancing in a sexual manner and referred to it as a ""try out"" and an ""opportunity.""

According to the complaint, Jones instructed the girls on how to shake or ""clap"" their buttocks and expose themselves in videos for him.

""At the beginning, get super close and say these lines: hey Austin, it's (name) and this butt is (age) years old and then make it clap for 30 seconds. Got it?"" Jones wrote on Facebook to the girl, the complaint states.

She ultimately sent him about 15 videos of her dancing, including 10 videos in which she exposed herself, the complaint states.

He spoke during an interview.
Mr. P, advised anybody who feels bad that he chose his wife and kids over his brothers and also wants to stop listening to his music because of it, to do so.
He said, &ldquo;It comes to a point in your life when you said&hellip;&rsquo;this is it.&rsquo;

756,"Controversial mulato Cool FM radio personality has been described as a hypocrite by his former colleague Princess Mikky Attah, for living illegally with his first wife who hadn&rsquo;t formally severed ties at the time with her ex-husband.
According to Princess Attah a certain man came out very publicly in the past to announce that his wife was living illegally with Freeze, even while legally married to him.
The veteran broadcaster (who claimed she was the one who interviewed Daddy Freeze when he was employed by Cool FM) in a post on social media hinted that the allegation by the man may have caused the break up of his first marriage.
Princess Attah said she was saddened at the time to hear that his marriage turned horrible and also wondered what role his church FreeNation Movement, and the Free the Sheeple Movement, played to prevent the break up.
She wrote; &ldquo;Daddy Freeze was to later straighten ME out on the business side of life, teaching me how to make my skills marketable, and not keep &ldquo;paying my dues&rdquo; all my lifetime! He was then hosting the Coca-cola Millionaire Show on TV .
After I left Cool Fm, I saw snippets of Daddy Freeze and the FreeNation Movement, and the Free the Sheeple Movement, and I was happy for him. I was unsettled when I saw his post about his &lsquo;partner&rsquo; &ndash; meaning the rumours of his marriage break-up were true.
&ldquo;Greater was my shock when he posted his pictures after being &ldquo;battered&rdquo;, as in domestic abuse while still married. Counter accusations kept flying (my ex-wife travelled out of the country with my kids without my knowledge). I couldn&rsquo;t help but wander &ndash; what role did their church play in preventing all this.
&rdquo;Also, what was the role the couple themselves played? I&rsquo;ve noticed that a lot of times when couples see that there is &lsquo;fire on the mountain&rsquo;, they seem to choose to keep feigning that all is well, rather than reaching out early for Godly counsel.
Their first thoughts are to &ldquo;please&rdquo; society and &lsquo;keep&rsquo; the marriage; but they do nothing new whatsoever, towards the &lsquo;keeping.&rsquo;
I am not &lsquo;active&rsquo; on social media and so I missed a whole lot &ndash; but a certain man came out very publicly to announce that his wife was living illegally with Freeze, even while legally married to him! I was totally shaken, and reading further, I saw that the man said his wife had left their base in Port Harcourt and had relocated with their 4 children to Lagos. She had sued him for divorce and was living with Daddy Freeze!
&ldquo;I am sad with myself I adjudged this as personal, and kept completely quiet. But now that my newsapp bombards me with Freeze reacts to &hellip;. Freeze reacts to&hellip;. every single time, I feel I have to speak to him, IN LOVE, and as a friend. From all responses I have seen, Daddy Freeze brooks no contrary opinion. But as one who knows him, I can also speak what&rsquo;s true to him.
I suppose I could get his personal contacts for a one &ndash; on &ndash; one. But then that will rob a lot of people of knowledge, people who react based ONLY on what they read, who do not have the benefit of the true picture of Daddy Freeze I have painted. Many more people could benefit from this,&rdquo; she wrote."

He expressed his disapproval of cyber crimes, adding that it is an offence against humanity no matter the living conditions in the country.
In a chat with E-Daily, Falz said, &ldquo;I think the government through their law enforcement agencies are supposed to come in and clamp down on people perpetrating such acts and make sure that people face consequences for their actions; because if they do face consequences, that could be a deterrent to other people thinking about committing such acts.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said this from the beginning of time and maybe I was the first person to get a backlash on this. I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of celebrating cyber-crime.

&lsquo;&rsquo;I will say it again and again; cyber-crime is wrong, cyber-crime is giving us a horrible name, especially outside Nigeria.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s destroying our youths and a lot of people are feeling it&rsquo;s the only option.
&ldquo;I understand the sentiment of people were not privileged and feeling like cyber-crime is the fastest way to get money.
&ldquo;But there are people out there actually putting in efforts, toiling, struggling to make it by doing legitimate stuff and not just taking from someone else.
&ldquo;One thing I believe is that you live your life, let others live theirs, as long as you living your life does not affect another person negatively.
&ldquo;But as long as you are taking from someone else, that is an offence even against humanity and it&rsquo;s bad.

Here are some reactions gathered from Twitter:
@4eyedmonk &ldquo;MURIC needs to know the difference between free-to-air TV and subscription based TV. DSTV where Big Brother is airing is a subscription based TV where you go to pay to consume content, because you want to not because you don&rsquo;t have other options.&rdquo;
@Zaddy_Nomso &ldquo;#BBNaija is a paid TV station, if you don&rsquo;t like it watch Nat Geo Wild. Some of our Moral leaders are assaulting Women and getting protected. MURIC where is this energy when there is suffering and killing in the land?
@Teefhay &ldquo;As a muslim sef I&rsquo;m sorry to say this but the leader of this MURIC is a fool.&rdquo;
@Balogun3103 &ldquo;MURIC sends petition letter to Buhari to cancel #BBNaija2019 with immediate effect. Nigeria is not Saudi Arabia.&rdquo;
@Buzuzu7 &ldquo;Dear MURIC more Nigerians die from hunger and depression and many more have no access to tv talk more of cable tv. Direct this energy at pressuring this government to make good policies that will have positive impact on the people.BBNaija2019 is the least of our problems.&rdquo;
@UniqueItohan &ldquo;So they are seeing tv reality show but blind to the havocs Fulani herdsmen are committing? You are telling me killing people in their own community, land or house is normal and can be over looked.&rdquo;
@DamyAdeyemi &ldquo;Although I&rsquo;m not a fan of #BBNaija2019, but asking govt to ban it is just laughable.&rdquo;
@Fikkypearl &ldquo;MURIC I&rsquo;ve not seen you guys cry out against Muslim clerics that rape girls, yet it&rsquo;s BBNaija that&rsquo;s your headache.You think Nigeria belongs to you, the show is rated 18 and let me remind you there&rsquo;s parental control on DSTV. Stop making noise Falz is still waiting for you in court.&rdquo;
@Ashawolord1 &ldquo;Plsss tell ur MURIC to channel their energy on giving u better advice. We Nigerians are not complaining about #BBNaija at least that&rsquo;s giving us much more pleasure than reading or watching ur Fulani herdsmen.&rdquo;
@Ayurmeday &ldquo;To start with, are we in a Muslim Country? Secondly, will stopping the reality show solve the country&rsquo;s problems?

According to TMZ, sources directly connected to the case said numerous witnesses testified before the grand jury, claiming Kelly&rsquo;s team secured travel at the singer&rsquo;s direction to move them across state lines for sexual purposes while they were underage.
According to the source, the grand jury is also hearing testimony that could lead to obstruction of justice indictments.
One of the alleged victims testified Kelly&rsquo;s team paid off witnesses to NOT testify in the 2008 trial where Kelly was acquitted of child pornography.
One of the families supposedly paid off by Kelly was the family of the alleged victim in the 2008 trial.
Prosecutors claimed the girl in a sex tape that was submitted into evidence was the goddaughter, but apparently, the jury was not convinced, because she did not testify.
The grand jury is keying into allegations Kelly and his team attempted to impact the outcome of the 2008 trial through witness intimidation and threats of bodily harm.
The grand jury testimony also revealed that witnesses in the 2008 case were allegedly sent on vacation when the trial was underway so they wouldn&rsquo;t be available to testify.

The offence could carry a sentence of between three to seven years in prison for each count. Kelly faces ten of them."

@Akah &ldquo;I woke up to several missed calls, and text messages. My friends know my relationship with CozaLet me say this. COZA is my church. I love my pastor. But rape is a serious issue. My stomach churns as I write this. I spoke with @timidakolo a week ago and tried to understand why he had taken a stance against my pastor. I had just come back from honeymoon when all my friends sent me his attacks to my pastor a few weeks ago. I sought to understand, not to attack. I was under so much turmoil too because this is my church, my pastor, and I cannot go around like nothing is happening and the church isn&rsquo;t addressing anything or re-assuring the members.
&ldquo;We must not see evil and cover it. We must not see evil and turn the other way. You all know me. I attack and speak out against corrupt political leaders every time. Well, this has hit home. Our leaders and our fathers must be held accountable. And they must deem us worthy to be answerable to. If we cannot clean the church, forget it. We cannot clean the country. I am tired of hearing so much, so much rubbish about my church and leadership over the years especially cos of the industry I belong to, nothing passes our ears behind the scene.
&ldquo;My pastor @biodunfatoyinbo has to say something this time. If the rest of the church does not need it, I need it. For my sake, sir&hellip; Speak on this.I stand with @busoladakolo as she has spoken her truth. I stand with the body of Christ also. I ask that my pastor come out and speak his own truth.
I am praying for the church. Please let us pray for both the Dakolo and the Fatoyinbo families. (wife and kids). In the end, if we need to, let us scatter the place&hellip; Then the truth will stand up.&rdquo;
@Rita Dominic &ldquo;Thank you for having the courage to speak up. Many girls and women have gone through this in silence. Those who spoke up were derided and abused. Never again! We support you Busola! We love you and we will stand by you. Hold your head high sister! Hold your head high! We are with you! I hope this encourages us all to be just as brave as you.&rdquo;

815,"Reno Omokri, a former aide of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, says the rape allegation against Biodun Fatoyinbo, founder of the Common Wealth of Zion Assembly, is false.
In an interview, Busola Dakolo, a celebrity photographer and wife of Timi Dakolo, had shared explosive details of how the flamboyant pastorraped her as a teenagerin her home in Ilorin.
She recounted the incident happened when she was 17 and out of secondary school.
The rape story rapidlygained negative tractionacross social media platforms and also topped on the menu of Twitter trends.
Omokri, who seems not to buy into the story, took to his Twitter account to explain why he thinks &ldquo;the rape story is false&rdquo;.
In a flurry of tweets, the ex-aide stated that although he never liked Fatoyinbo for personal reasons but the preacher was too &ldquo;sleek&rdquo; and wont stoop so low to &ldquo;rape an underage girl&rdquo; in her parents&rsquo; house.
&ldquo;I have NEVER liked Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of COZA for reasons that I will not say publicly. However, I am mature enough to divorce my emotions and be led by logic. And I counsel those now condemning him to do the same,&rdquo; he wrote.
&ldquo;Think. Don&rsquo;t emote. A pastor comes to your house early in the morning. He does not know who will open when he knocks, or who is at home. He knocks and immediately you open he pushed you to a chair and raped you in your pyjamas. Do people think?
&ldquo;Even the most USELESS movie director won&rsquo;t accept such a plot in a B rated Hollywood/Nollywood/Bollywood movie. A movie has to have PLAUSIBILITY. I don&rsquo;t like pastor Fatoyinbo, but I won&rsquo;t suspend my intellect because of my dislike of the fellow.
&ldquo;After he allegedly raped her, she kept quiet for enough time for him to go to his car and get a soda drink for her? It does not ADD UP. My dislike for Biofun Fatoyinbo won&rsquo;t make me become a SLANDERER by default. This story rings very FALSE.
&ldquo;I am an advocate of morality. For years, I publicly preach against premarital and extramarital sex. I pastored a congregation in Abuja for years. I will NEVER, EVER, support RAPE. But Satan is going about like a roaring lion seeking whom to consume!
&ldquo;Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo is SLEEK. Too sleek for my liking. What type of sleek man will rape an underaged girl in HER PARENTS HOUSE? While HER SIBLINGS are AT HOME. And then leave her to go get a drink from his car. Is this mass HYPNOSIS?
&ldquo;Do we Black African of the Nigerian variety think at all? Do we only exist in the soulish realm? I have a Masters in Law from England. The story CANNOT stand up in court. The story CANNOT stand up in the light of cross-examination.
&ldquo;I give you my word that if you gave satan 10 minutes to manipulate the minds of Nigerians, he will get a sizeable number of Nigerians to believe that Jesus is evil and the Satan is good. We are too gullible, excitable and emotional. #ForTheBodyOfChristNotForFatoyinbo.&rdquo;"

819,"The detectives in Los Angeles, who probed the death of Michael Jackson, have revealed that the lateKing of Pop&rsquo;s death was more than a case propofol overdose.
Propofol is an intravenous drug used commonly for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia.
According to media reports,&lsquo;Killing Michael Jackson&rsquo;, a new documentary backed by graphic evidence and previously undisclosed details of his death, revealed that the iconic singer wasn&rsquo;t being helped to fall asleep with the fatal dose anesthesia that killed him.

&ldquo;Sometime during this medical emergency, Dr Murray had stopped either giving CPR or had waited to give CPR and cleaned up everything. Within 48 hours, it appeared that it was a suspicious death in that there was something more than just an overdose,&rdquo; they said.
&ldquo;The room where he was being treated, did not seem like a room fit for any type of medical treatment. It was like a home, a makeshift medical suite. It was just bare bones. We found a bunch of more medicines that were used, like propofol.&rdquo;
Scott Smith, in the discovery, also recounted his encountering &ldquo;an IV stand, a saline bag and just various medications strewn about.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We found all the waste, all the trash. The needles, the empty bottles, the stuff that, when we went into the room, should have been laying there,&rdquo; he said.
The documentary, which features vivid photographs from inside Jackson&rsquo;s room and his personal physician&rsquo;s belongings, would be aired on Quest Red TV on June 22, 2019.
Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication in 2009, at his Los Angeles home, while still under the care of Murray, his personal doctor. It was revealed that he had dubbed the deadly painkiller his &ldquo;milk&rdquo;.

Paparazzi are independent photographers who take pictures of high-profile public figures such as actors, athletes, politicians, and other celebrities, typically while the subjects go about their usual life.

824,"Chidinma Leilani Aaron, the 42nd lady to emerge Miss Nigeria has added her voice to the ongoing crisis in Sudan which according to reports is putting the country on the brink of disaster.
According to a statement issued by the current Miss Nigeria, it is worrisome that the crisis in Sudan which sparked off after the ousting of a long-reigning dictator is sparking fears that the military is gripping onto power.
Chidinma is also disturbed that hospitals in the capital of Sudan had estimated &ldquo;more than 70 cases of rape&rdquo; during the attack and its aftermath, which also saw over 100 deaths and at least 700 injuries.
The beauty queen also added that there is clearly a pressing need to put an end to the chaos and the spiraling human rights abuse, especially the efforts of the media in the creation of awareness on this matter.
Her statement reads thus; &ldquo;There are numerous reports on the &ldquo;tragic violence against protesters swinging out from Sudan. This is reported to be following the removal of longtime Sudanese President, Omar al-Bashir, who was President for a longtime/30 years.
To be of positive help, I believe it is important to understand the issue in this region, objectively. There is also the need to look into the cause(s) extensively, in order end the violence and to arrive at an effective way to avert a repeat of the region&rsquo;s previous military-strong regimes of oppression.
&ldquo;As reported, hospitals in the capital had estimated &ldquo;more than 70 cases of rape&rdquo; during the attack and its aftermath, which also saw over 100 deaths and at least 700 injuries. This is a glimpse into the effect of the on going violence in Sudan. There is clearly a pressing need to put an end to the chaos and the spiralling human rights abuse, especially.
I recognise the efforts of the media in the creation of awareness on this matter. However, more needs to be done by the media to open up this issue. This will aid in attracting all the support needed to expunge the present violence going on in Sudan. Thus, restoring peace to the region. This is a strong purpose my message aims to serve.
&ldquo;Amid the chaos its important to note the progressive events being recorded in relation with the current state of Sudan. This includes the work of UNICEF (an organisation which focuses on helping disadvantaged children across the globe) in the region. They also offer a variety of ways those interested in aiding their efforts could become involved. There are also petitions calling for a UN investigation into the massive violence against protesters earlier this month.
There are ongoing pushes for awareness on the issue from celebrities and public figures across the world who decided to use their platforms to publicly support the protesters and others affected by the violence.
It has been reported, as well, that the U.S. sent Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Tibor P. Nagy, accompanied by a special envoy to meet with leaders in Sudan. That was in efforts to support a political solution to the current crisis that reflects the will of the Sudanese people.
The meeting was scheduled to hold in Khartoum and Addis Ababa from the 12th -13th of june, 2019. As the proceedings of the meeting are awaited, I urge us all to focus our energy on positive efforts aimed at bettering the plight of the Sudanese people.
&ldquo;In conclusion, I applaud the positive contributions of various individuals and groups who moved and keep moving towards providing food and relief supplies to those affected by the violence. Also, I celebrate all those poised towards fostering peace and good governance in Sudan. On this note, I call on every well meaning individual and group to contribute their qouta to ensuring peace across our continent, Africa."

851,"About 13 firms and 45 persons are under the watch list of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for allegedly engaging in fraudulent activities in the capital market. The investigation according to report, is part of collaboration between capital market regulators and the anti-graft agency.
In a list of cases under investigation obtained at the weekend showed that the commission is investigating 40 cases involving 13 firms and some 45 persons while the anti-corruption agency is already prosecuting another two firms and 12 persons for involvement in capital market fraud.
Even though the complete details of the cases and names of the firms and individuals could not be disclosed due to legal privacy and ongoing investigations, a review of the cases indicated that theyrelate to four broad categories of unauthorized sale of clients&rsquo; shares, diversion and misappropriation of clients&rsquo; funds, impersonation and operating phony or illegal investment schemes and services.
 It was learned that, the impersonators usually seek to take advantage of knowledge gap or absence of the owners of the shares. They seek to take advantage of the dormancy of some investors&rsquo; account as well as fraudulent conversion of shareholding estates.
The firms under investigation include Lakesworth Securities Limited, Bytofel Trust &amp; Securities Limited, Gosord Securities Limited, Securities Solutions Limited, ITIS Securities Limited, Kingsway Securities Limited, Mact Securities Limited, First Equity Securities Limited, Omas Investment &amp; Trust Limited, Mayfield Investment Limited, Cadington Securities Limited, GMT Securities &amp; Asset Management Limited, Quantum Securities Limited and Giljohn Investment Ltd.
Disciplinary Committee and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-through its Administrative Proceedings Committee (APC) run an active investigative mechanism that seeks to uncover malpractices, sanctions indicted operators and restitutes affected investors. However, both NSE and SEC lack prosecutorial powers.
Capital market authorities had bridged the gap between their investigative powers and prosecutorial powers through Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the EFCC, which allows the organizations to collaborate on information sharing, investigation, prosecution and enforcement.
SEC and EFCC had earlier in January 2017 signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that formally established the alliance between the two Commissions. The MoU seeks to promote the efficient investigation and conclusion of all cases reported by either of the institutions to each other and to promote the integrity, efficiency and soundness of the Nigerian capital market and the economy in general.
According to the MoU, the institutions shall provide each other with the utmost mutual assistance in any matter falling within their competences, including in particular the following areas: secondment of middle cadre officers, training to enhance the investigative skills and capacity of personnel of the institutions and consequently increase the general output and performance of the institutions and facilitate better understanding of each others&rsquo; functions through capacity building programmes and human capital development in the areas of investigation of fraud in the capital market.
The institutions will also collaborate in the areas of exchange of information to assist the performance of the institutions&rsquo; respective functions, reporting, investigation and prosecution of fraudulent and manipulative practices in the Nigerian capital market and any other activity as agreed between the institutions from time to time."

&ldquo;It should never be encouraged. I am really disappointed.

RMD, as he is popularly put up a post on his Instagram page on Wednesday, calling the attention of the police to the case of a man identified as Idris Ebiloma who allegedly raped a 4-year-old girl in Abuja.
The actor urged the Police to prove to seek justice for the minor alleged to have been raped.
His letter reads: &ldquo;An open letter to FCT Police Command.
&ldquo;Dear CP Bala Ciroma, I am hearing rumors that nearly 3 years ago, in your jurisdiction, a full grown man Mr. IDRIS EBILOMA allegedly raped a 4-year-old child. All rapes are evil, damaging and unforgivable but the rape of a child? That in itself is not only the worst form of rape but one of the most heinous crimes anyone can commit but more disheartening than the crime itself is the allegation that the police is frustrating efforts to get this innocent child the justice she so badly deserves.
&ldquo;With the increased spate of insecurity, abuse of personal freedom (especially by SARS) and now rape. The police cannot play ostrich and pretend to be unaware of the mood of the nation. What better time and what better way to prove that the police is indeed our friend by ensuring that the investigation and evidence(s) presented to the court are thorough and an ironclad case made against the offender.
&ldquo;Sir, I have never met you but I hear that you&rsquo;re a good man and I am going by that assumption which is why I am writing you this open letter, hoping that the power of social media will lead it to you and trust that you will live up to your reputation and use your noble office to get KHLOE the justice she deserves.
&ldquo;That way she grows up having great hopes in our law enforcement and judiciary.
&ldquo;Sir, CP Bala, we are rooting for you to write your name in gold in Nigeria&rsquo;s history by being the one who made it happen. Kind Regards, Richard Mofe-Damijo.&rdquo;"

848,"Nigeria being the number one producer of beans in the world still spends N16bn annually to import the produce from neighboring countries, the Federal Government has said.
Mr Bitrus Bako, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Science and Technology stated that the recent certification of environmental safety of genetically modified beans would help to bridge the gap in production. 
Bako, stated this at a training for journalists organized by the Open Forum for Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa in Abuja on Thursday. 
 The permanent Secretary, who was represented by Director, Special Duties, Mr James Sule, gave the assurance that the quality of genetically modified beans expected to be released in 2020 would be safe, nutritious, harmless and insect free.
The National Biosafety Management Agency had recently approved the environmental release of pod bearer resistant beans in the country. This is expected to be followed with a commercial release which would mark the release of the crop for sale and consumption.
Bako said, &ldquo;Prior to the release, cowpea (beans) production has been achieved only through extensive applications of pesticides aimed, in part, at battling the devastating bean pod borer. Farmers were forced to spend money on eight or more pesticide applications at each planting cycle. Yet, they still lose 80 per cent of their yields to the voracious insects.
&ldquo;It may interest you to note that Nigeria is the number one producer of cowpea globally yet there is consumption deficit of half a million tonnes, prompting imports from neighbouring countries like Cameroon and Burkina Faso which is estimated to cost N16bn annually.
&ldquo;With BT cowpea, the gap in production will be bridged and Nigeria will save N16bn on its import.&rdquo;
The permanent secretary also expressed confidence that the recent approval of genetically modified cotton would revolutionise the industrial and agricultural sector.
He said that the decline in cotton production in the country impacted negatively on the textile industries leading to the comatose state of Nigeria&rsquo;s cotton mills and other supporting businesses.
In his presentation, Director General of the National Biotechnology Development Agency, Prof Alex Akpa, listed the steps the country had taken to realise the potential of biotechnology in the country and expressed confidence that Nigeria would soon begin to reap the benefits of its investment in the sector."

The Electronic commerce platform, with its headquarters in Lagos, Nigeria, had last Friday listed its shares on the NYSE, and traded at $14.50 under ticker symbol JMIA. The prospectus, showed that Jumia offered 13,500,000 American Depository Shares representing 27,000,000 Ordinary Shares.
In an interaction with journalists in Lagos, yesterday, the Chief Executive Officer, Jumia Nigeria, Juliet Anammah, said the firm contemplated many venues, met with lot of investors, but New York seemed the more natural place given the number of investors familiar with the business model.
According Anammah more investors have a marketplace and tech focus in New York than in any other place. &ldquo;We made a logical choice. This is the largest stock exchange in the world; many technology companies are listed on the NYSE (Alibaba, Twitter, Snap.),&rdquo; she said.
Explaining the reason for the Initial Public Offering (IPO), Anammah said Jumia has been private for seven years, and the management sees a lot of positive aspects to being public.
According to her, the move is about creating more trust and raising the public profile to help with the business, among others raise the public profile to help bring more sellers to Jumia. The move is expected to help build even more trust with consumers, in particular, those who are still not comfortable with eCommerce, just as the listing will help with talent recruitment, retention, as it aimed to attract more attention from top talent.
She said the IPO is all primary, and about providing the resources to Jumia, and not to selling shareholders. The Jumia CEO explained that Jumia operates in Nigeria and 13 other African countries, and will never go beyond them. She stressed that Jumia has invested heavily in tackling major infrastructure challenges, including investing in logistics, delivery and has also developed a proprietary online payments technology.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also worth noting that though our two CEOs are French, like many companies where CEOs/Founders are of a different nationality, and a small team of key account managers in Dubai (to oversee partner brands whose HQ are in Dubai).&rdquo; Jumia&rsquo;s management and staff in most countries are largely local, including country heads. We directly employ more than 5,000 people in Africa and believe that our business has a significant indirect impact on job creation across the continent,&rdquo; she stated.
In terms of investors, Anammah said Jumia has international shareholders, like many other companies, and &ldquo;we are bringing investors to the African tech scene and building the economy and talent there. Though initially funded by German investors in 2012, we got one of our main shareholders (and still do to date) MTN in SA. It is amazing that international investors are bringing positive news to the whole tech scene in Africa and for many more startup companies after us. Now that we are public, any African investor is welcome to invest in Jumia."

&ldquo;This change relates primarily to one project in Nigeria now under construction. Recognising that this one major project is in West Africa, the prospects for North and East/South Africa continue to be for further increases in regional net product imports.
&ldquo;Since the project is in West Africa, its implementation does not necessarily alter the situations in North and East/South Africa. What should happen, especially in West Africa, is a reduction in the need and opportunity for product imports.&rdquo;
Mr Devakumar Edwin, The Group Executive Director, Strategy, Portfolio Development and Capital Projects, Dangote Industries Limited, said OPEC was correct in its estimation, adding that all hands were on deck to deliver the refinery on time.
According to him, Dangote Group&rsquo;s ongoing refining and petrochemicals project can meet 100 per cent of the domestic demand for petroleum products (petrol, diesel, kerosene and aviation fuel), leaving the surplus for export in line with OPEC&rsquo;s expectation.
He said that the high volume of petrol output from the Dangote refinery would transform Nigeria from a petrol import-dependent country to an exporter of refined petroleum products."

One trader was quoted as saying that backwardation and low refining margins had reduced the appeal of Nigerian crude for European buyers.

On the refining capacity, the NNPC boss said that &ldquo;Nigeria needs a refining capacity of 1.52million Barrel Per Stream Day (BPSD) of crude oil in order to meet its PMS requirement by 2025.
&ldquo;This capacity requirement includes Dangote&rsquo;s 650,000 BPSD Refineryand NNPC&rsquo;s current nameplate capacity of 445,000 BPSD (WRPC, KRPC and PHRC). This leaves a shortfall of 20million liters which is equivalent to 427,000BPSD.&rdquo;
The Group Managing Director however explained that in order to address this shortfall in PMS demand,NNPC is adding 215,000 BPSD of refining capacity through private sector driven co-location of our existing facilities in Port Harcourt Refinery Company (PHRC-100,000 (BSPD) and Warri Refiningand PetrochemicalsCompany (WRPC-115,000 BPSD) respectively.
Baru further said that &ldquo;Additionally,NNPC throughits new initiative of establishing Condensate Refineries with private sector participation is providing clusters for in-country refining capacity totaling about 250,000BSPD which closes the PMS supply-demand gap and creates positive margins to the investors.
According to Baru Nigeriais the largest economy in Africa and dominant in the West African sub-region, with an increasing energy demand.
He added that based on available forecast, Nigeria&rsquo;s real GDP was US$320 billion as at 2015 with a growth potential of US$476 Billion by 2025 (averaging 4% per annum).
Baru said that Nigeria&rsquo;s petroleum product demand is expected to grow from 13.2 million metric tonnes in 2015, 15.1 million metric tonnes in 2020 and 17.3 million metric tonnes by 2025 while the population growth corresponding to this demand is 182 million in 2015, 207 million in 2020and 234 million in 2025 respectively.
