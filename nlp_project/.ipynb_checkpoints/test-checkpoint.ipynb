       "In a move that is completely unsurprising to many, Google’s AI research division has announced that they are issuing PhD degrees to select employees.\n",
       "Industry research organizations like Google Brain, DeepMind, and FAIR are well known as heavy hitters in the artificial intelligence research community, publishing as many papers (if not more) as academic institutions like Stanford, Berkeley, and MIT. Many top professors from academia have migrated over to industry research labs as well, sacrificing the security of academic tenure for fat stacks of money. Although Google has previously experimented with research residencies, this is the first time that they have issued postgraduate degrees.\n",
       "According to a representative, the tech giant decided to issue PhDs in order to attract scarce AI talent. “It’s extremely difficult to find people with talent in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence these days, and it pained us to see so many of our amazing interns decline our return offers to go back to school for PhDs. With the Google PhD program, we can continue to get the best talent while supporting our student-employees with world class resources and technology.”\n",
       "For graduate students, the Google PhD program is a sweet deal. There is already a well-known pipeline where top graduate students do their PhDs at a university, intern at industry research groups during the summer, and then sign on full time after graduation with the promise of million-dollar compensation packages and the freedom to set their own research agendas.\n",
       "However, aspiring AI researchers must still struggle through the difficulties of academia: four to six years of low pay, begging for funding, and advisors who can be sadistic, micromanaging, or absent. In contrast, Google offers researchers massive computational resources and motivates their PhD advisors with a potent combination of vegan snacks, kombucha, and equity refreshers. Instead of receiving a boring paper diploma at the end of their PhDs, Google PhD graduates receive a priceless note handwritten by Jeff Dean on a napkin that says, “You have a PhD now.”\n",
       "Other tech companies are scrambling to build their own research groups so they are not left behind in the “AI revolution.” Halting Problem reached out to a representative from Salesforce AI Research who said, “What? Google is doing it? Well, guess we are too.”\n",
       "In the meantime, Google is already planning for the next way to find top AI talent. According to a knowledgeable source, Google is in talks with Khan Academy to create a “machine learning kindergarten” program that teaches children Tensorflow."

For me, Morocco is one of the favorites to win the Cup, just like Ivory Coast, which won twice,''\\n''I think Egypt, which will play at home, is the number one favorite. There is also Senegal, the best African team in the FIFA rankings.\\n''As I said before, Morocco remains a favorite of this CAN, Tunisia too.

       "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo wednesday charged military officers and men to be ready always to defend Nigeria with their lives.\\nOsinbajo, who served as the reviewing officer at the passing out parade of the Direct Short Service Course 28 of 2019 comprising 187 new officers, held at the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Base in Kaduna, described military career, which is to defend the territorial integrity of the country, as the most civic service.\\nAccording to him, beyond earning salary and getting a chance to wear a coveted uniform, the military should put their lives on the line for the safety and welfare of Nigerians.\\nHe, however, told the new military officers that Nigeria was still grappling with insurgency in the North-east, and kidnapping and banditry in other parts of the country.\\nThe vice president said given the security challenges confronting the nation, the new officers would soon be busy by fulfilling their responsibilities to the military and the country.\\nHe said: &ldquo;As you already know, this profession you have chosen requires absolute discipline, loyalty and hard work. It is much more than just securing a job, or earning a salary; and more than just getting the chance to wear a coveted uniform or wield coveted weapons. This is the ultimate form of civic service to defend the territorial integrity of your country and to put your life on the line for the safety and welfare of millions of your countrymen and women. There is no nobler occupation than this one you have chosen.\\n&ldquo;You are passing out at a time when our nation is grappling with an insurgency in the North-east, and the challenges of kidnapping and banditry in other parts of the country. You will, therefore, have come to terms with the fact that the days and weeks and months ahead of you will be extremely busy, as you fulfil your responsibilities to the military and the nation.\\n&ldquo;While the armed forces have effectively contained the territorial ambitions of the Boko Haram terrorists by substantially degrading their capacity to attack and wreak havoc, they remain intent on shedding blood and sowing fear. There is also the threat of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) in the Lake Chad Islands and part of Southern Borno.\\n&ldquo;Also, more often these days, these insurgents are focusing on soft targets, opportunistic attacks on isolated military units, as well as an increasingly sophisticated propaganda aimed at making them out to be more organised and lethal than they really are.\\n&ldquo;This ever-increasing reliance on propaganda is a reminder that this is not only a &lsquo;battleground&rsquo; war; it is just as much an information-and-narrative war. Winning hearts and minds has always been important in military warfare; it is even more so in a century defined by information and communication technologies.\\n&ldquo;As 21st-century military officers, how you project your strength and confidence to your enemies and the world, especially using social and digital media tools, is as important as the sophistication of the conventional arms and ammunition that you wield.\\n&ldquo;But to do so effectively also means that you must take the time and trouble to fully understand the nature of the threats that confront us, the narratives and philosophies that underlie those threats,&rdquo; the vice president stated.\\nOsinbajo told the officers that President Muhammadu Buhari, in collaboration with governors, has been reviewing the security architecture of the country, which involved not just the armed forces but also the police, who have recently announced their community policing strategy.\\nHe said: &ldquo;This initiative involves the recruitment and training of policemen in each local government and ensuring that such new policemen remain in their local governments working with local and traditional authorities to maintain peace and security.\\n&ldquo;As the President has said, security is a 24-hour occupation involving continuous investments in strategy and innovation. We will continue to take all necessary measures to tackle all forms of criminality across the country and to safeguard lives and property of all Nigerians.\\n&ldquo;The Nigerian Air Force will, as part of the Armed Forces, continued to be at the forefront of our national security interventions. I note in particular the extremely successful digitally accurate bombings of terrorist hideouts in April that led to the destruction of Boko Haram mechanic workshop in Borno&ldquo;In May, there were airstrikes on Tumbun Hamma on the fringes of Lake Chad, inflicting heavy casualties on ISWAP forces under Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole; while in June, airstrikes on Sambisa Forest further eliminated insurgents&ldquo;It is particularly commendable that you are adopting measures to ensure that the resources available to you are used judiciously; in a manner that delivers optimal results and maximum value for money.\\n&ldquo;This nation is great and can only become greater. We are Africa&rsquo;s largest economy by GDP &ndash; states of Nigeria have larger economies than many African states. We have become the last frontier for major economic growth.\\n&ldquo;We are the world&rsquo;s largest growers of cassava and yams, we are top five in the world in sorghum, millet; we are approaching self-sufficiency in paddy rice production. Our potential in technology and entertainment has been attracting huge attention.\\n&ldquo;First is the market, at 174 million GSM phones, we are top 10 telephone users in the world, and we have the highest percentage of people who use internet on their phones in the world. We are also number two in mobile internet banking in the world; 17 million Nigerians are on Facebook.\\n&ldquo;Microsoft has announced that it will establish a 100 million dollar African Develop Centre in Nigeria. We are already building our own drones. But not only are we building drones, we are also making spare parts for our aircraft. We are also manufacturing armoured personnel carriers and all sorts of different military platforms.\\n&ldquo;All of these are things that Nigerians are doing in this country. Just last week, we saw, at the Army Day, sophisticated mine sweepers that are manufactured in this country. In a few short years, this country will be, by far, the greatest military force in Africa and certainly the most developed economy in Africa.\\n&ldquo;All of these have been built on the sacrifices of many in blood and sweat, especially men and women of the armed forces. What will undermine our efforts now and in the future is disunity. All of those who are preaching narratives of divisions along ethnic and religious lines. We must resist all who try to destroy our present gains and in particular our future.\\n&ldquo;The future of our country is bright; all we need to do is to keep focus not to allow any to preach any division amongst us. If we remain stable and united, everything that we desire for our great country will be ours.&rdquo;    1\n",

I have loved it. I grew so much as a player. Derby is such a great club.\\n''The manager has shown me a lot of confidence playing me in a lot of games. I have nothing but good words to say about Derby, the club, the fans and my team-mates.\\n\"I am really proud. We are disappointed and we are hurting, but we had such a fantastic season. Even though we lost, we still had a lot of good moments to look back on and cherish.\\n\"I am not really thinking about Chelsea at the moment but we will see when the new season comes''.\\nTomori is

       "Ghanaian forces have rescued two Canadian women who were kidnapped last week outside their hostel in Ghana&rsquo;s city of Kumasi, the Ghanaian government said in a statement on Wednesday.\\nThe women, aged 19 and 20, were volunteers for charity Youth Challenge International.\\nKidnappings were rare in Ghana until a spate of abductions late last year, most of them were carried out in demand for ransom.\\nThe media hadreported that the kidnap will be the second time in less than a month that foreigners will be targeted in the city of Kumasi. An Indian national earlier was abducted and rescued.\\nHowever, Ghana&rsquo;s president Nana Akuffo-Ado has vowed to crack down on kidnappers amid fears the abductions could harm tourism while Canadian officials thanked the Ghana government for its cooperation in the resolution of the case.

       "The National chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, has said that there is no government in Nigeria.\\nThe chairman also criticized the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration&rsquo;s approach to handling security issues in the country.\\nWhile addressing newsmen in Abuja on Friday, Secondus questioned the existence of a government in the country, stating that Buhari&rsquo;s incompetence in the handling of governance is taking a huge toll on the nation.\\nThe PDP chairman noted that the security situation in the country has become continued source of concern among prominent Nigerians, including clerics and monarchs.\\nHe therefore urged the President to seek quality advice on the security challenges.\\n&ldquo;While the Presidency continues to argue that there exists government in our country today, what obtains in reality is different,&rdquo; he said.\\nSpeaking further, he said &ldquo;The level of bloodletting occasioned by the barrage of criminalities across the country can only be happening in a country without government. &ldquo;Things got even worse as the remaining goodwill of the people on this government vanished after it arm-twisted the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), into tampering with the will of the people in the February 23 Presidential and National Assembly Elections.\\n&ldquo;There is no evidence of the presence of government in this country as crimes of all kinds are being committed all over the country and Nigerians have never lived in such great fear and trembling for their lives.\\n&ldquo;From Kaduna to Zamfara, Benue to Taraba, Plateau, Lagos to Enugu etc., bloodletting is continuing unabated. Even the President&rsquo;s home state of Katsina has lost about eight local government areas to bandits, not to talk of the North East.\\n&ldquo;Everyone holding public office must know that one day, they will be held accountable for their actions.&rdquo;\\nSecondus condemned the incessant killings in Kaduna State, where a British humanitarian aid worker, Faye Mooney and others were shot dead by gunmen last week.\\nHe blamed the heightened insecurity in Kaduna on what he described as &ldquo;provocative leadership&rdquo; existing in the state and which he said, is indirectly being encouraged by the Federal Government.\\n&ldquo;The situation has deteriorated to the extent that this country can no longer protect the lives of international aid workers who are here to help us clear our mess.\\n&ldquo;The senseless continuous bloodletting in Kaduna state should be blamed on the type of provocative leadership existing in that state and indirectly encouraged by the federal government.\\n&ldquo;The &lsquo;body bag&rsquo; governor in the state does not seem to know how to engender peace among the people, his actions and utterances facilitate, instead of ameliorating the ill feelings among the people,&rdquo; Secondus said.\\nFurthermore, Secondus alleged that the Federal Government has been exerting energies and resources planning nefariously how to undermine democratic institutions.\\nHe said, &ldquo;After its several attempts to hijack the legislature failed, it turned to the Judiciary ridiculing the revered third arm of the government to the point of removing their confidence.\\n&ldquo;The executive backed humiliation of the head of the Judiciary, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen is a well-designed strategy by the APC administration to intimidate and coerce judicial officers, particularly the Judges and Justices to fall in line and endorse all their undemocratic behaviours that are bound to come to the judiciary for adjudication.\\n&ldquo;My advice to members of the Judiciary, particularly those handling election matters and who are all Nigerians and who are also living in Nigeria is that the country and rule of law should guide all their actions.\\n&ldquo;They should know that providence has placed in their laps the opportunity to make positive history and enshrine justice and fair play in our society, knowing as a fact that no nation grows on injustice and injustice breed crisis&rdquo;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "Brighton was able to advance to the FA Cup semifinals by winning via penalty kicks against Millwall yesterday. However, the match should have been won by Millwall in regular time, but Brighton received a gift by tying the match at 2-2 in extra time at the end of the second half.\\nBrighton's Solly March attempted a free kick from about 30 yards from goal, and the kick appeared to be an easy save for Millwall goalkeeper David Martin. However, the goal slipped through his hands for the game to go into extra time. After the match went to penalty kicks, everyone knew that Millwall would be eliminated from the FA Cup because he was still demoralized for letting that goal in.\\nNevertheless, I do not feel sorry for Millwall because their fans are known to be some of the worst sports fans in the world.\\n

According to the Nairobi Wire, the National Recovery and Action Plan for Giraffes has been set up to combat the decline of the animals due to poaching, habitat loss and climate-shock diseases.\\n60% of the world&rsquo;s animal population has been wiped out by human activity in the past 40 years.Kenya has lost 40% of its giraffe population in the past 30 years with only 659 Rothschild&rsquo;s giraffes remaining.\\nThere are approximately 8,700 reticulated giraffes, also known as Somali giraffes, in southern Somalia and southern Ethiopia and approximately 2,645 Nubian giraffes, mainly found in west central Kenya, South Sudan, western Ethiopia and northern Uganda.\\n&ldquo;Whilst giraffes are commonly seen on safari, in the media and in zoos, people including conservationists are unaware that these majestic animals are undergoing a silent extinction,&rdquo; Julian Fennessy, the co-chair of the Species Survival Commissions Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group says in a press release.\\nJani Actman on National Geographic reports that many giraffes are slaughtered just for their tails, which are considered a status symbol and have been used as a dowry when asking a bride&rsquo;s father for his daughters hand in marriage in some cultures.\\nThe Kenyan government has launched a land-use programme to secure the habitats of endangered giraffes. However, increasing funding for anti-poaching efforts can do some good, stopping habitat encroachment is a much more difficult prospect, since it would mean interfering with land development, mining and other economic activities and livelihoods.\\n\\nThe biggest problem for giraffes though, may be the lack of attention over the years.\\nGiraffes have silently been going extinct across Africa over the last century. The animal is already gone from seven countries, Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal. Furthermore, the &lsquo;National Recovery and Action Plan for Giraffes&rsquo; was launched as of 2018 until 2022. The initiative aims to address challenges for the sustainable conservation of giraffes in Kenya.\\n&ldquo;Each and every animal on Earth has as much right to be here as you and me&rdquo;\\nWe have an obligation to protect Giraffes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "Following incessant killings, church leaders in Nigeria have said that Christians are experiencing \"pure genocide\" as 6,000 people, mostly women and children, have been murdered by Fulani radicals since January.\\nIn a press release made available to journalists, the Christian Association of Nigeria, (CAN) and church denominational heads in Plateau State said that \"What is happening in Plateau state and other select states in Nigeria is pure genocide and must be stopped immediately,\"said\\nThe church leaders said that \"over 6,000 persons, mostly children, women and the aged have been maimed and killed in night raids by armed Fulani herdsmen,\" which is prompting their cry to the government of Nigeria \"to stop this senseless and blood shedding in the land and avoid a state of complete anarchy where the people are forced to defend themselves.\"\\nIn the press release, they church leaders also pleaded with the international community, as well as the United Nations, to intervene in the Fulani attacks, fearing they might spread to other countries as well.\\n\"We are particularly worried at the widespread insecurity in the country where wanton attacks and killings by armed Fulani herdsmen, bandits and terrorists have been taking place on a daily basis in our communities unchallenged despite huge investments in the security agencies,\" they added, saying President Muhammadu Buhari has failed to bring attackers to justice.\\nThey referenced several mass-scale attacks this year, including the killing of over 2000 people, mostly Christians, at the end of June in raids carried out by the herdsmen on local area farmers near the city of Jos.\\nAlthough some international news media has sought to characterize the killings as a land conflict between community groups, the church leaders, along with major persecution watchdog groups such as Open Doors USA and International Christian Concern, have all said that Christians are being deliberately targeted.\\n\"We reject the narrative that the attacks on Christian communities across the country as 'farmers/herdsmen clash.' The federal government has been so immersed in this false propaganda and deceit while forcefully pushing the policy idea of establishing cattle ranches/colonies on the ancestral farming lands of the attacked communities for the Fulani herdsmen as the only solution to the problem,\" the press release declared, accusing the government of also pushing such a narrative.\\n\"How can it be a clash when one group is persistently attacking, killing, maiming, destroying; and the other group is persistently being killed, maimed and their places of worship destroyed? How can it be a clash when the herdsmen are hunting farmers in their own villages/communities and farmers are running for their lives?\" the church leaders asked.\\n\"How can it be a clash when the herdsmen are the predators and the inhabitant/indigenous farmers are the prey? Until we call a disease by its real name and causatives, it would be difficult to properly diagnose the disease for the right curative medications.\"\\nDifferent reports on the number of Christians killed in Nigeria since the start of the year have emerged.\\nThe International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law, Intersociety,statedon Tuesday that a combined total of 1,750 Christians, along with non-Muslims, have been killed both by the Fulani herdsmen, and by Boko Haram radicals, who are a separate terror group.\\nIntersociety also warned of a genocide in its statement.\\n\"Nigeria is drifting to [a path of] genocide through killing, maiming, burning and destruction of churches and other sacred places of worship, and forceful seizure and occupation of ancestral, worship, farming and dwelling lands of the indigenous Christians and other indigenous religionists in Northern Nigeria,\" it said.\\nRoman Catholic Bishop William Avenya of Gboko separately told charity Aid to the Church in Needthat the world cannot wait for a full-on genocide before deciding to intervene.\\n\"Please don't make the same mistake as was made with the genocide in Rwanda,\" he pleaded, referring to the massacre of Tutsi people in Rwanda, where close to 1 million were killed in 1994.\\n\"It happened beneath our noses, but no one stopped it.

The remaining 75% chance depends on an unrelated matching donor being found&rdquo;. \\nAs part of its broad corporate social responsibility (CSR), Dana Air said it has been in the forefront of supporting sickle cell and cancer awareness programs across Nigeria. \\nThe airline has also been supporting one of the organizers of the events &ndash;Project PINK BLUE, in its drive to create

       "he National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), the Nigerian professional body that regulates the activities of the electronic media has sanctioned 45 broadcast stations over alleged ethical violations during the general election.\\nSpeaking at a news conference in Abuja on Friday, the director-general of the commission, Is&rsquo;haq Kawu, said the affected media houses were fined N500, 000 each for flouting the provisions of the Nigerian broadcasting code.\\nThe director-general warned that any station that continues to broadcast inciting comments that threaten the security and corporate existence of the country would be shut down completely.\\n&ldquo;Despite our various interventions, at the end of the presidential election which was held on 23, Feb. 2019, 45 stations were found culpable of infractions on the provision of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code and have been sanction accordingly,&rdquo; Kawu said.\\n&ldquo;We gave them the highest level of sanction under the NBC which is to make them to pay N500,000 each and the cut across the entire country. &ldquo;NBC also sanction stations that allowed politicians to utter abusive, inciting and provocative statements during rallies.\\nHe said the sanctioned stations cut across the country, among which are big name stations such as Channels Television, TVC, AIT and NTA.\\n&ldquo;There are also several radio and TV stations involved in this various infraction. &ldquo;Only recently J FM for instance in Jos, Plateau State was sanction for inciting broadcast by a preacher, who move away from religion into the arena of politics and was saying particularly inciting comments.&rdquo; He said.\\nHe maintained that the NBC had set up a national team to monitor stations on 24 hours basis as the country moves closer to the governorship election.\\n

       "The face off began and ended with a 2-0 victory for Arsenal , ending Man United&rsquo;s 12 game winning streak, landing Arsenal 3 points, moving them to 4th place on the table being 2 points ahead of United and 1 point behind Tottenham at 3rd place.\\nArsenal begins the first half strong scoring 12 minutes into the match. Granit Xhaka left footed shot from outside the box to the bottom left corner with assistance from Alexandre Lacazette. A goal somewhat suspicious according to the United fans saying that the goal only went in because &lsquo;the wind was on Arsenal&rsquo;s side tonight&rsquo; , lol. \\nIn the second half Arsenal seem to start of shaky before finding their footing and landing their second goal of the night. Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang steps up to the plate with fans worried and hoping that there wasn&rsquo;t going to be a repeat of the players north London derby miss. Despite missing from the same spot he was in against Tottenham Aubameyang takes the penalty with a right footed shot to the centre of the goal sending the keeper the wrong way. IT&rsquo;S IN. Arsenal 2, Manchester United 0. \\nSoon after Arsenal's second goal, a fan ran on to the pitch and shoved United defender Chris Smalling before heading to the Arsenal players. Metropolitan Police reported that a man had been arrested on suspicion of common assault and pitch invasion following an incident that took place during the match and that he was in custody at a north London police station.\\nFull time Arsenal 2 Man United 0. \"Tottenham Hotspur, we're coming for you\" is all you can hear. Chanting from Arsenal fans filled the Emirates Stadium as Arsenal celebrated their win.\\nAfter the game Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang told &lsquo;Sky Sports&rsquo; Jamie Redknapp how he had made sure he didn't make the same mistake saying, \"I was confident, my team-mates give me a lot of confidence. Laca gave me the penalty and that was cool from him, I was really focused. I made a mistake against Tottenham, looking down at the last moment, not watching Lloris, but today I watched until the end - and being focused you score a penalty. I know where the ball is and you have to practice this all the time, and today it went in! I knew that it would be tough, but I was feeling confident and if I missed this one, what can I say?\" He concluded by speaking on behalf of his team saying, \"We have a good spirit, we are hungry. We want to come back into the Champions League and we're all focused on that.\" \\nThe end of the end is the best place to begin. Even though Ole Gunnar Solskj&aelig;r&rsquo;s unbeaten record in the league is over, he acknowledges how his team played and hasn&rsquo;t lost faith as Man Utd prepare to face on Wolves. Ole Gunnar Solskj&aelig;r; &ldquo;We started slow, maybe a backlash from Wednesday night,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We were too slow the first 15 minutes &ndash; he [Xhaka] had time to hit that ball [for the opening goal]. But we created so many chances, so many more than when we beat them in the cup but that doesn&rsquo;t help when the result is like it is. It is not scratching your head, sometimes that happens. We hit the woodwork twice, sometimes strikers take them. I know more than anyone, as a striker, that that can happen. I can&rsquo;t remember any proper saves that David [de Gea] had to make. They didn&rsquo;t really carve us open. It is one of those days, we have to dust ourselves down and now we play Wolves in the FA Cup.&rdquo;\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

       "National team coach of Nigeria, Gernot Rohr, insists John Obi Mikel is still part of Super Eagles while hinting that he will meet with the experienced midfielder in the coming days to decide on his availability for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.\\nThe former Chelsea player has not appear in any of Nigeria&rsquo;s six games in the qualifiers prompting speculations that he might have decided to quit international football.\\nRohr, however, was swift to clear the air with an exclusive interview covered by Osasu Obayiuwana:\\n&ldquo;This is the question that I and my team will resolve. I will soon go to see him at @Boro. There are many things to consider but I respect him and what he has done for Nigeria. He remains an important player,&rdquo; the gaffer told the journalist.\\n&ldquo;He has been away from the team for a year but we qualified for the AFCON without him. His absence, as our captain, has been evident. But he has had to deal with a range of issues, after the World Cup in Russia.&rdquo;\\nThe ex-German defender also provided updates on the fitness level of Super Eagles first choice goalkeeper Francis Uzoho who is loan at the Cypriot club Anorthosis Famagusta.\\n&ldquo;I have sent Enrico Pionetti, my goalkeeper trainer, to @anorthosisfc, to work on him. At the moment, it&rsquo;s not, for now, a question of him being number one but of his being one of our three goalkeepers for the AFCON.&rdquo;\\nAside from Mikel and Uzoho, Rohr also have a big decision to make on whether to allow talented youngster Samuel Chukwueze represent Nigeria at the 2019 FIFA U -20 World Cup in Poland next month or include him in his team for the AFCON finals in Egypt.\\n&ldquo;He is a great talent and I would like him in my team, although I don&rsquo;t know if he will be an immediate starter. The challenge, of course, is that he is also wanted for Nigeria&rsquo;s @fifau20 team going to Poland.\\n&ldquo;&hellip; I have had a chat with the coach of Villarreal and they don&rsquo;t want him to exhaust himself at the U-20 WC and the AFCON, so they want him to choose one tournament. We shall see how best we can manage this situation. But no doubt, he&rsquo;s a talent for my team.&rdquo;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
       "The detectives in Los Angeles, who probed the death of Michael Jackson, have revealed that the lateKing of Pop&rsquo;s death was more than a case propofol overdose.\\nPropofol is an intravenous drug used commonly for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia.\\nAccording to media reports,&lsquo;Killing Michael Jackson&rsquo;, a new documentary backed by graphic evidence and previously undisclosed details of his death, revealed that the iconic singer wasn&rsquo;t being helped to fall asleep with the fatal dose anesthesia that killed him.\\nOrlando Martinez; Dan Myers; and Scott Smith, the detectives, who led Jackson&rsquo;s death probe, also revealed the contents of the singer&rsquo;s &ldquo;makeshift medical suite&rdquo;, a room wherein the singer spent his final hours.\\nAccording to them, Conrad Murray&rsquo;s drug-filled bag was found in Jackson&rsquo;s room which was cluttered with &ldquo;drugs and syringes&rdquo; at the time of his death.\\n&ldquo;Sometime during this medical emergency, Dr Murray had stopped either giving CPR or had waited to give CPR and cleaned up everything. Within 48 hours, it appeared that it was a suspicious death in that there was something more than just an overdose,&rdquo; they said.\\n&ldquo;The room where he was being treated, did not seem like a room fit for any type of medical treatment. It was like a home, a makeshift medical suite. It was just bare bones.

       "Francis Uzoho is pleased to have been handed an opportunity to feature for the Super Eagles again after he was named in Nigeria&rsquo;s provisional squad for the 2019 Africa Cup Of Nations in Egypt.\\nUzoho&rsquo;s inactivity for Anorthosis Famagusta, coupled with his mistake in Nigeria&rsquo;s last AFCON 2019 qualifying match against Seychelles in Asaba somewhat reduced his popularity ahead of the final tournament in Egypt.\\nThe goalie&rsquo;s blunder saw Melaine Rody cancel out Odion Ighalo's opener in the match against the Seychelles.\\nBut having been included in the provisional list ahead of the AFCON 2019 finals, Uzoho hopes to redeem his image when he gets the chance to feature at the tournament\\n&ldquo;Another privilege to represent my country. Hope I get the opportunity to make you all proud. In Christ Alone,&rdquo; Uzoho wrote on his Instagram status page on Wednesday.\\nThe 20-year-old who has kept four clean sheets in 13 games for the Super Eagles since he made his debut as a second-half substitute for Nigeria in their 4-2 win over Argentina in November 2017, also thanks his former team Elche for handing him an opportunity to play during the first half of the season.\\nUzoho made nine appearances for Elche in the Segunda division conceding 11 goals and keeping four clean sheets.

       "Kenyans planning to travel to the UK can now breathe a sigh of relief after the launch of an online visa application process that will enable them to do it locally and easily in Nairobi. The new service Access UK, is designed based on customer feedback and comes in as a replacement for the existing Visa4UK.\\n\\nThis move will greatly improve the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) SERVICE. It makes it more convenient, faster and easier for users to apply for the United Kingdom Visa. The Access UK, the Home Office's new online application process is now available in Kenya and over 200 other countries in the world. A number of customers will however continue using the old system VISA4UK until the roll-out is completed before the end of 2019.\\n\\nCustomers will be automatically redirected to the site fromGOV.UKpage which can be accessed through the Applying for visa to come to UK page.\\nIn a statement the UK government stated that for convenience purposes the website shall allow customers to smoothly transition from ACCESS UK to making appointments on the TLS website.supporting evidence needed towards the application process shall also be easily uploaded. further customers can also select and make payments for additional services easily on the site.

       "Reports gathered from various media in China have confirmed that super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo, will only be out for two weeks after it was feared his injury was more severe.\\nNigerians were left scratching their heads after Ighalo suffered an injury, which led to his substitution in the 12th minute of Shanghai Shenhua's 1-1 draw vs Tianjin Teda on Friday and it was speculated that the striker was going to miss the Africa Cup of Nations.\\nAfter tests carried out on the Super Eagles star this weekend, the injury has been classified as a hamstring problem and he is facing two to three weeks on the sidelines.\\nSuper Eagles gaffer Gernot Rohr will have every cause to feel relieved given the news, as there is nothing to worry about Ighalo whose participation in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations is still within the time frame for his recovery and his return date if he does not suffer a relapse.\\nThe former Watford man is certain to miss Shanghai Shenhua's next league match vs Shandong Luneng, while he is doubtful to face Dalian Yifang and Chongqing Dangdai Lifan.

       "With the presidential election just five days away, the people of the South East have continued to express their support for the candidate of the People's Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar who they believe has got the right answers to the questions that have been on their lips.\\nOn a certain Monday morning in Enugu, former South East Capital, The Eastern People&rsquo;s Front, EPS threw their weight behind the candidacy of Atiku Abubakar in the presidential election insisting that no sane individual of Igbo extraction will agree to vote for the APC- led administration for a second term in office looking at how poorly they have managed the affairs of the country.\\nAbubakar had chosen Peter Obi of Igbo extraction and a former governor of Anambra State as his running mate.\\nThe forumsaid that 2019 presidential election is a defining one for Nigeria and is very crucial and critical to the continued co-existence and survival of the Igbo people and provides accelerated pathway for Nigeria president of Igbo extraction through a major political party.\\nWhile addressing newsmen during its National Executive Committee meeting ahead of the presidential election, the National President of EPF, Elder Ken Emechebe said that the forum have since the 2019 electioneering process started, studied, consulted and placed side-by-side the governance programs of the president and the APC with that of his closest competitor, Atiku Abubakar who in their estimation has made proposals that suit the ideals of Ndigbo.\\nHe stated that the forum does not hate president Buhari and the ruling APC government as generally stated, but is rather only neither amenable to his character as a leader nor to his politics.\\n&ldquo;We have been wrongly perceived as a menace to the peace of other Nigerians, yet we are not. We have been unjustifiably killed by our country men, yet we hold out love for humanity anywhere. Our resources have been plundered time and time again, yet we rebuild and continue to create wealth for the society&rdquo;. He said.\\nHe regretted that &ldquo;The Nigeria- Biafra war was supposed to have ended in 1970, but it is being prolonged against the Igbo people by those who have the power to end it, but chose not to. Instead, they have continued to mischaracterize the Igbo people and their Igbo nature to live and promote one Nigeria in every part of the Nigeria&rdquo;.\\nAccording to him, the decision of the EPS to support Atiku and urge all Igbos to massively cast their votes for him and the PDP at the presidential election is based on his stance on the restructuring of the country, enthronement of true federalism, and creation of an enabling environment for all Nigerians to thrive.\\n&ldquo;Our choice of Atiku and the PDP is based on our estimation that the chances of a Nigerian president from Ndigbo in 2023 is most feasible therein than it could be with Buhari and the APC which has shown that it has a closed mind towards the Igbo nation&rdquo;\\nSpeaking further, he said &ldquo;We have about 26.7 million Igbo registered voters. We do hope that about 17 million of them will come out and vote for Atiku in the election so as to show him how committed we are in making the country a better place with him&rdquo;.\\nHe stated that the Igbo people will not be stampeded, cowed or intimidated on election day and that they will remain wherever they registered to vote and also warned that whoever decides to provoke they people in their peaceful way will be rebuffed.\\nMeanwhile, former minister of Power and member of the NEC of the EPF, Prof. Chinedu Nebo has describe as faceless, nameless and uncelebrated the faction of Ohanaeze led by former Secretary-General, Uche Okwukwu that visited and apologized to president Buhari, for the announced endorsement of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar for the 2019 elections by the main body.\\nSpeaking during the NEC meeting, Nebo said that there are no two Ohanaeze Ndigbo and so, whoever went behind to speak against the decision making body is only pursuing selfish interest and not speaking for the Igbo nation.\\nIt will be recalled that Okwukwu opposed the endorsement of the PDP candidate by the president of Ohanaeze, Nnia Nwodo and later announced that President Buhari had been adopted as the Presidential candidate of Ohaneze, a development which attracted his expulsion by the body.\\nReacting to this, Nebo said that the position of Ohanaeze Ndigbo is to stand by any leader who has the interest of the Igbo nation at heart because the body represents the corporate vision for the emancipation of the Igbo race.\\n&ldquo;There is absolute neglect of the Igbo nation.

       "The Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai, has assured Nigerians that no effort will be spared in flushing out the remnants of Boko Haram insurgents in the north-east region of the country.\\nHe made the statement on Tuesday when he declared open the 2019 Nigerian army infantry corps conference in Jaji, Kaduna State, adding that bandits do not come from the moon.\\nBuratai, however, appealed the support of Nigerians in the fight against insurgency. He explained that insurgents live among ordinary citizens and patronise the same markets, therefore intelligence gathering was necessary.\\nAccording to him, &ldquo;terrorism is quite a complex phenomenon and situation that requires a more comprehensive approach, which comprises in totality of government, and the involvement of every individual in the country.&rdquo;\\nHe explained that the army is employing maximum intelligence in its efforts to combat and contain all forms of insurgencies.\\n&ldquo;Bandits or insurgents don&rsquo;t come from the moon, they are everywhere, they go to markets to make purchases, interact with people every now and then, hence the need for information and intelligent gathering and sharing to help achieve the required results,&rdquo; Buratai said.\\n&ldquo;The Nigerian armed forces will continue to discharge their duties in the protection of the territorial integrity of the country.\\n&ldquo;The change in the Nigeria army and its innovation are quite outstanding. With our collective effort with other security agencies, we were able to deal decisively with the Boko Haram insurgences.\\n&ldquo;Today we have the full initiative in collaboration with the members of Multi National Joint Task Force countries, we are working hard to ensure that we finally sanitise the northern part of Borno, our border fringes with Niger, Chad and Cameroon.\\n&ldquo;Within the hinterlands, some of them are still hibernating in the remote areas, they are planing and we are also planning to counter them.\\n&ldquo;We will ensure that we employ the maximum intelligence required to contain those within the hinter land.\\n&ldquo;If this is done, we will be able to contain insurgency at anytime it rears its ugly head. It cannot be left to the traditional rulers, local government chairmen, state governors or the federal government institutions like the military, police or the Armed Forces alone. It is the collective responsibility of everybody.\\n&ldquo;Every individual and society has a role to play. If the overall populace sees it as their own responsibility to support government and security agencies, it means we are going to resolve every security issues in the country.&rdquo;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

       "South Africa coach Stuart Baxter has claimed that Bafana Bafana defenders will not man-mark Odion Ighalo when they face Nigeria in Wednesday evening's Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinal clash in Cairo.\\nThe former Watford striker has been Nigeria's most influential player at the ongoing tournament, having a hand in four (3 goals, 1 assists) of the five goals scored by the three-time African champions.\\nAnd Baxter has revealed that one of the ways to nullify Ighalo's threat is simply to cut off supply to the Super Eagles number 9.\\n''We don&rsquo;t make individual plans for players in terms of man marking. We would solve that as a team,'' Baxter said.\\n''We would make it difficult for them (Nigeria) to play quality balls to their strikers and would defend like we normally defend.\\n''That is part of the ways you can make individual strategies to certain players. Being a central striker, Ighalo will fall into the back four as a unit, and we&rsquo;ll screen the midfield which will make it difficult for him.''\\nIghalo specializes in scoring from inside the penalty area and all his international goals have come from inside the box with the exception of his opener in a 4-0 win vs Cameroon in September 2017.

       "The flying eagles of Nigeria fell to a 2-0 defeat against the United States of America in their second Group D game of the 2019 U-20 World Cup at the Bielsko-Biała Stadium on Monday evening.\\nPaul Aigbogun, the coach of the Nigerian side, made just one change from the starting XI that trounced Qatar last time out, with Jerome Akor replacing Tijani Muhammad upfront.\\nThe Yanks that showed the most initiative into the game and it paid off when Sebastian Soto headed home off an Alexis Mendez corner with barely eighteen minutes played.\\nAnd after skipper Ikouwem Utin saw his header saved by USA goalie Scott in the first period, Soto yet again punished a hesitant Nigerian backline just after the break to put his side 2-0 up.\\nAigbogun's changes could do little to inspire his charges and in truth, the boys toiled through out the game and will now have to get a favourable result versus Ukraine in their last group game if they must progress to the next round.

end of the 2018-2019 campaign before he is loaned to Besiktas for two years.\\nBesiktas are hoping to conclude talks after the end of election for a new club president later this month.\\nOnyekuru is on the radar of several top clubs in Europe because he has not been issued a British work permit, and the likes of Bayern Munich, Valencia, Sevilla and Monaco have recently scouted him.\\nThe 21-year-old has played 40 games for Galatasaray in all competitions, scoring 15 goals and setting up four others.

       "President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has launched the Rearing for Food and Jobs (RFJ) campaign, another module of his administration&rsquo;s flagship programme &ndash; &ldquo;Planting for Food and Jobs&rdquo;.  The campaign, which will run for five years, from 2019 to 2023, according to President Akufo-Addo, &ldquo;will develop a competitive and more efficient livestock industry, that will increase domestic production, reduce importation of livestock products, contribute to employment creation, and improve livelihoods of livestock value chain actors&rdquo;.  Launching the campaign on Monday, 25th June, 2019, in Wa, in the Upper West Region, the President bemoaned the steep decline of Ghana&rsquo;s livestock sector, which has been largely attributed to the high cost of production, and competition from cheap imports of livestock and its products, forcing most livestock producers to stop producing meat, and to concentrate solely on crop production.  With Ghana importing $400 million worth of meat products annually, and with local meat production accounting for only 19% of the country&rsquo;s meat requirements, President Akufo-Addo stated that these grim statistics are an indictment on the country, and that is why success has to be made of the Rearing for Food and Jobs campaign.  Towards addressing the challenges confronting the country&rsquo;s livestock industry, the President stated that RFJ will focus its attention on breed improvement, productivity and production, development of infrastructure (housing, plant and equipment, slaughtering, processing and marketing facilities), feed production and conservation of forage, animal health and disease control, development of communal grazing lands, commercialisation of livestock production and entrepreneurship development, and application of e-agriculture in livestock production.  &ldquo;By design, the campaign will cover selected value chains in the livestock sector namely, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry chicken and guinea fowl,&rdquo; he added.  With only 6 breeding farms currently in operation, as opposed to 28 in 1993, the President told the gathering that &ldquo;the breeding stations that were closed down at Wawase in the Eastern Region, Wulugu in the North East Region, Doba in the Upper east Region, Busa in the Upper West Region, and Wenchi in the Bono Region, are being revived.&rdquo;  Furthermore, he indicated that, under the RFJ programme, the Wawase cattle ranch, currently in operation in Afram Plains, which is accommodating some 3,000 cattle will be replicated in regions that experience farmer-herdsmen conflicts, or serve as corridors for the transhumance.  &ldquo;In the five-year period of the RFJ campaign, it is projected that forty thousand, five hundred (40,500) small ruminants, mainly sheep and goats, thirty eight thousand (38,000) pigs, two hundred and fifty eight thousand (258,000) cockerels, and over six hundred and sixty thousand (660,000) guinea fowls, which will not fly to Burkina Faso, will be distributed to livestock farmers and would-be farmers, throughout the country,&rdquo; President Akufo-Addo said.  He continued, &ldquo;three thousand (3,000) cattle farmers will benefit from a programme of artificial insemination to increase average meat production. These planned interventions are indicative of the important attention now being given to the livestock sector after years of neglect.&rdquo;  Farmers, who receive sheep or goat shall pay back in kind, with two offsprings per adult breeder supplied, and farmers, who receive breeding pigs, shall pay back in kind with three piglets for each breeding pig supplied.  Cockerels will be supplied to farmers at fifty per cent (50%) of the market value. Day-old chicks and guinea fowl keets will be supplied at fifty per cent (50%) subsidy to farmers, with farm capacity not exceeding two thousand (2,000) birds. Cattle farmers shall benefit from subsidised imported semen to improve the meat and milk performance of their cattle.  Components of RFJ  Towards addressing the seasonal inadequacy of feed, both in quantity and quality, the RFJ campaign will develop low-tech ways of transforming millions of tons of crop waste into millions of tons of high-quality animal feed, with potential to create an industry worth millions of cedis a year, and create thousands of jobs in Ghana.  &ldquo;To achieve this, government will procure and subsidise forage harvesting, bailing machines and equipment to enable livestock farmers conserve enough crop residue for dry season feeding of animals. Maize and soybean production, which are already being given the necessary support under the Planting for Food and Jobs initiative, will provide enough feed for the poultry at lower than usual cost,&rdquo; President Akufo-Addo added.  Whilst acknowledging that poor disease control could jeopardise the contribution of the livestock sector to food security, employment creation, and general economic development for both Ghana, the President indicated that the disease control and surveillance component of RFJ will pay heed to controlling the transmission of animal diseases, study of diseases, development of vaccines, as well as capacity building for technical expertise, and specialised skills to improve the preparedness for dealing with the challenges of outbreaks.  Also, the enhancement of the Pong Tamale Veterinary Training College, the Disease Investigation Farms in Techiman and Savelugu, and the Disease Diagnostic Laboratories in Accra, Tamale and Kumasi, will be undertaken as a matter of urgent priority.  The introduction of e-agriculture, in the RFJ campaign, the President said, will give actors of the livestock value chain access to comprehensive and up-to-date information on livestock production, market prices, disease outbreaks, farm management techniques and practices, and, above all, traceability in the livestock production sector.  In concluding, President Akufo-Addo tasked the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to ensure rapid information flow to the citizenry on how they can access the facilities pertaining to the RFJ campaign.  &ldquo;There should be effective and extensive dissemination of information on modalities of implementation of the RFJ campaign right after the launch to ensure the needed and expected participation of citizens. When that is done, the objectives of the campaign will be achieved, and the expected dividends from Government&rsquo;s investment realised,&rdquo; the President stressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
       "Ahead of the 2019 general elections and for the first time, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has released a total of 1000 election observers across the country to monitor the elections.\\nThe President of the association, Rev Samson Ayokunle, while speaking on Sunday during a service at the Trinity Baptist Church, Ajobo, Ibadan, Oyo State, said the observers would observe malpractices that may arise during the elections and relay same to the control room at the Christian Secretariat in Abuja.\\nAccording to him, &ldquo;You know, for the first time in the history of CAN, we are sending election observers across the federation to observe how elections are going on. &ldquo;If there is any malpractice anywhere, they will report (it) immediately to the control room at the Christian Secretariat in Abuja. We are sending 1,000 election observers across the federation and we had never done that before. It costs money but we are committed to it,&rdquo; he said.\\nHe further noted that except Christians take this week to engage in prayers, it was not certain the elections would hold. &ldquo;About what is happening in the country, I want you to pray very well this week. If it&rsquo;s about the things we see in the spirit, it is not sure that elections will hold at all. We won&rsquo;t want elections to hold like they didn&rsquo;t hold; if that should happen, it would cause trouble or even lead to war&rdquo;. He said.\\nHe also stressed the need for prayers against &ldquo;People who think they are powerful&rdquo; and were determined to sabotage the electoral process to suit their selfish and personal interests at the expense of the over 180 million Nigerians.\\nCAN, however, expressed confidence in the leadership of the Chairman of Nigeria&rsquo;s electoral umpire, Prof Yakubu Mahmood who it says cannot play with the collective wish of Nigerians.\\nSource:https://www.ripplesnigeria.com/nigerian-christians-deploy-1000-election-observers-urge-members-to-be-vigilant/

       "Anthony Joshua, 29, was due to defend his IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight titles against undefeated American Big Baby Miller, who has never fought for a world title. However, he&rsquo;s been denied a licence to fight the Briton by the New York State Athletic Commission following an adverse finding from a drugs test in March. \\nEarlier on Wednesday, Joshua&rsquo;s promoter, Eddie Hearn said on Twitter of the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) test: &ldquo;We have been informed by VADA that there has been an adverse finding in Jarrell Miller's sample collected on March 20, 2019.&rdquo;\\n&ldquo;We are working with all relevant parties and will update with more details soon.&rdquo;\\nMiller's camp have now requested a B sample to be tested and if that sample comes back negative then Miller can make another application for a licence.\\nGood news for Aj&rsquo;s fans as he&rsquo;s still eager to make his debut in America. The heavyweight champion has pledged that his American debut will go ahead as planned at Madison Square Garden in six weeks&rsquo; time even though he might not be going against his original opponent who would of earned $6&thinsp;million (&pound;4.6&thinsp;million) for the fight.\\nHearn, told Telegraph Sport: &ldquo;We are talking to other potential opponents. The first person I called when I learnt the news was Anthony, and he said &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fight anybody. The event goes on. Just get me an opponent&rsquo;.&rdquo;\\n&ldquo;We had a dozen calls from fighters wanting an opportunity and we will go through the serious ones. Anyone in the top 15 in the world is acceptable, but the higher ranked, the bigger the name, the better.&rdquo;\\n&ldquo;In an ideal world, we would prefer it to be an American opponent, but there are 17,000 tickets sold and 10,000 Brits are flying over. How many of those were coming to watch Miller?&rdquo;\\nMatchroom chief executive Frank Smith told BBC Sport: &ldquo;Our plan right now is that we carry on with Madison Square Garden on 1 June and we will announce more details soon.&rdquo;

governors to partner with the Federal Government in the execution of its anti-corruption agenda.\\nHe also encouraged them to work towards building a socially cohesive society in which the resources

       "Elephants to me are the worlds most majestic creatures. Traits associated with the elephant are: strength, wisdom, solitude, loyalty and intelligence.\\nSeeing and walking with Elephants at the Ol jogi Conservancy, Nanyuki, Kenya was one of the most pleasant experiences of my life. Seeing Elephants standing proud and tall, ears twitching with merriment takes me back to the old saying &ldquo;saving one animal will not save the world but surely, for that one animal the world will change forever&rdquo;\\nThere are parts of me that feel blessed at never having seen an Elephant at a zoo or behind a cage.\\nElephants are a reminder that you are stronger than you think. They remind us to learn from our past so as to not repeat the same mistakes and with their poor eyesight and strong sense of smell they teach us to trust not what we see but instead to trust our other senses.

It was the desire of the Federal Government to take a holistic approach that gave birth to the Ruga settlement model and it is not only for Fulani herders.&rdquo;\\nBut the Senior Special Assistant to the Vice-President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Laolu Akande, said in a tweet on Friday that the programme being handled by Osinbajo was different from the one being referred to by Miyetti Allah.\\nAkande clarified that the National Livestock Transformation Plan, which had been endorsed by the National Economic Council, was different from the Ruga programme.\\nHe tweeted, &ldquo;Contrary to claims reported in sections of the media, Ruga settlements are not being supervised by the Office of the Vice President. Ruga is different from the National Livestock Transformation Plan approved by state governors under the auspices of the National Economic Council.\\n&ldquo;On the National Livestock Transformation Plan, 13 States are already in the process of implementation of a plan to transform the livestock production system in Nigeria along market-oriented value chain while ensuring an atmosphere of peace and justice.\\n&ldquo;The states are Adamawa, Benue, Kaduna, Plateau, Nasarawa, Taraba, Zamfara, Katsina, Kano, Kogi, Kwara, Ondo, and Edo. These states are at different stages in the process but have indicated readiness to implement the plan. Truth is: this Federal Government will not impose on any state government regarding its land.\\n&ldquo;NEC okayed the plan based on the recommendation of a technical committee of the council chaired by Ebonyi State Governor Umahi. Other state governors who were on the committee and working group are Adamawa, Kaduna, Benue, Taraba, Edo, Plateau, Oyo and Zamfara-mostly the frontline states.&rdquo;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

       "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said with the 3,500 million standard cubic feet per day of additional gas supplied, the nation's economy can create up to seven million jobs and boost the Gross Domestic Product by about $50bn\\nAccording to the Corporation's Group Executive Director/Chief Operating Officer, Gas and Power, Mr Said u Mohammed, the nation's current proven gas reserve had increased to 202 trillion cubic feet from the initial figure of 199tcf.\\nMohammed stated this during a presentation at a technical symposium organized by the society of petroleum Engineers.\\nAccording to Mohammed, despite the growing importance of natural gas in the country, some factors were hindering the optimal domestic utilization of gas.\\nHe said, the factors include gas pricing, supply security, the inadequacy of gas infrastructures and infrastructure vandalism.\\nHe said, the seven critical gas development projects were at different stages of development and would help to bridge the supply gab in the domestic market.\\n\"The NNPC is aggressively expanding and integrating the domestic gas pipeline infrastructure network system, thereby creating a robust gas pipeline infrastructure grid. Currently, all existing power plants are connected to permanent gas supply pipeline\", Mohammed said.\\nAccording to him, a vast range of investment opportunities span across the value chain and are ready to be explored.\\nHe said, there had been an upsurge in the development of gas processing plants and the NNPC had responded by creating a Subsidiary company in the Nigerian Gas Company bto drive all investments and partnerships to develop gas processing plants.\\n\"As more gas-based industries projects are being developed, gas utilization would significantly increase, which would have a positive positive effect on domestic industrialization, employment and economic well being.

       "Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has insisted that Moses Simon got the nod to start ahead of Samuel Chukwueze in his side's hard-fought 3-2 win over Cameroon on Saturday evening because the Levante winger has better defensive qualities than the Villarreal starlet.\\nTrailing 2-1, the introduction of Chukwueze in the 61st minute changed the outcome of the game as the Super Eagles equalised before grabbing the winner five minutes after he subbed in.\\n''The question is easy to answer, you know when you have some offensive players like Oyongo, the left-back from Cameroon, who is coming forward all the time and you have an offensive strong player like Chukwueze but defensively not so good like Simon Moses, who plays in his club a more defensive position because they play 3-5-2,'' said Gernot Rohr at the post-match press conference.\\n''He's playing on the right or the left side, so we decided to start like this to have stability in the team and to bring in Chukwueze in the good moment. He came in after 16 minutes in the second half.\\n''I don't believe that it changed the result but it helped us to win and to score the two goals.''\\nThe Super Eagles will now face South Africa on Wednesday, July 10 with a place in the semifinal at stake.\\n

       "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) plans a proposal for the alteration of the 1999 Constitution as amended to enable it reduce the plethora of political parties in the country, which it said created for it a logistics nightmare during the 2019 general election.\\nAccording to the commission, the large numberof parties, which made it to design very long ballot papers, confused many voters, particularly the less educated, during the election.\\nIf the situation persists, said the commission, not only will the logistics nightmare persist, it would continue to put illiterate voters in a dilemma.\\nThe position of INEC was made known at the weekend by its National Commissioner on Information and Voter Education, Mr. Festus Okoye, in an address in Makurdi, Benue State capital.\\nHe said the commission was planning a review of the process of registering and deregistering political parties as well as how the parties choose candidates for the general election.\\nAccording to him, INEC is pushing for amendments to the Constitution and review of guidelines on party registration and deregistration to empower it to tighten up the registration process and delist parties that were &ldquo;mere platforms&rdquo; for political jobbers.\\nThe commission expressed dissatisfaction with the extant registration regime, which it said has led to the nation&rsquo;s electoral process being saddled with an unwieldy number of parties.\\nPresently, Nigeria has 91 registered political parties of which 73 fielded candidates for the 2019 presidential election.\\nINEC unfolded its plans just as former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, who was the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last general election denied planning a protest over the commission&rsquo;s denial that it has a server where it stored election data.\\nIn his address, Okoye identified the conduct of opaque and flawed party primaries as the root of the plethora of pre-election matters pending in the various courts.\\nAs part of the overhauling of the party registration process, the commission, he said, would present a new alteration to the constitution that will enable it deregister political parties.\\nHe said: &ldquo;Nigerians must engage in root and branch review of the number of registered parties in Nigeria. The present framework for the registration of political parties is inadequate to guarantee the registration of qualitative, membership driven and ideologically propelled political parties. Some of the political parties are mere platforms and have no concrete and visible presence in most states of the federation.\\n&ldquo;The presence of too many political parties on our ballot papers has in some instances confused some of our compatriots that are not well endowed in literacy. It has bloated the ballot papers and result sheets and trucking them to the polling units has become a logistics nightmare.\\n&ldquo;The commission will present alternatives to the Nigerian people, including alteration of the constitutional regime that ties registration of political parties to visible, verifiable and concrete presence and structures in at least half of the states of the federation.\\n&ldquo;The commission will also propose a rational and democratic threshold for getting on the ballot and save the Nigerian people the phenomena of &lsquo;also ran.&rsquo;\\n&ldquo;The commission will also propose further alteration of the conditions for the deregistration of political parties as the 4th Alteration to the Constitution is inadequate to weed out dormant and commercial platforms with little or no visible structures and presence in any of the states of the federation. The Nigerian people need political parties that can bid for political power and not mere commercial platforms for hire.&rdquo;\\nHe also decried the acrimonies that usually trail the conduct of parties&rsquo; primaries, which he attributed to the high number of pre-election cases in the court.\\n&ldquo;The commission believes that the conduct of opaque and flawed party primaries is at the root of the plethora of pre-election matters pending in the various courts,&rdquo; he said, adding: &ldquo;The commission will propose constitutional alteration that aligns the resolution of pre-election issues and the activation of the issuance of certificates of return to the 21-day rule in the Electoral Act, 2010(as amended).\\n&ldquo;In other words, lodging an appeal within 21 days of obtaining an unfavorable judgment at the court of first instance automatically stays the execution of the judgment and the issuance of a certificate of return pending the determination by the court of Appeal and possibly, the Supreme Court.&rdquo;\\nHe said the commission will engage the leadership of the judiciary relating to the territorial jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to the handling of pre-election matters, contending that a situation where primaries are conducted in one state and all the suits relating to same are trucked to another state for determination is not healthy for the electoral process.\\nHe said the commission would also engage the leadership of the judiciary on multiplicity of court orders on the same issues and by the same parties from courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\\nAtiku Disclaims Planned Protest over Server\\nMeanwhile, Atiku, at the weekend, denied reports about his alleged plans to lead a violent nationwide protest if his petition at the presidential election petition does not succeed.\\nThis came as the issue of whether the electoral commission has official server, where the results of the last general election were electronically transmitted to or not continued during the week, with a report querying the N2.27 billion budgeted for server-related procurement items.\\nAtiku described a statement being circulated against him as handiwork of mischief-makers to mar his pro-democratic record and lay the groundwork for false charges against him.\\nIn a statement by his media aide, Mr. Paul Ibe, the PDP presidential candidate said such a statement did not emanate from him.\\n&ldquo;I wish to emphatically state that such a statement did not emanate from Atiku Abubakar or his privies. It is the work of mischief makers who want to mar his spotless pro-democratic record and lay the ground work for their threatened actions against him on false charges of being a threat to national security,&rdquo; Ibe said.\\nHe added: &lsquo;&rsquo;For the avoidance of doubt, Atiku Abubakar believes in the rule of law and in the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In his almost four decades in politics, he has never taken action or spoken words against democracy and will not start now.&rsquo;&rsquo;\\nAtiku added that he has confidence in God and called on those bent on mischief to have the fear of God and retrace their steps.                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
       "The main opposition party in the last presidential election, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has alleged that the Nigerian military now shares the powers of President Muhammadu Buhari with him.\\nThe PDP was reacting to the position of the US on the conduct of the 2019 elections, adding that theinvolvement of the military in the conduct of the elections had shown that the President had either abandoned his job or that the military were no longer ready to face their constitutional roles of defending the territorial integrity of the country.\\nThe PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, made this known while reacting to the US assessment of the elections, adding that the military were behind the states whose elections were declared inconclusive by INEC.\\nAccording to him, the military practically took over the control of the elections by allegedly deciding who is to vote and if such a vote would count in many states.\\nSecondus also alleged that the military took over collation centres in states like Rivers and Bauchi, barring even officials of INEC from gaining access to the centres where votes were meant to be counted and collated.\\nAccording to him, &ldquo;It is not only the US that is disappointed; millions of Nigerians are also sad with the conduct of the elections. This is the first time in the history of elections in Nigeria that the military will be dictating the pace and whether the votes will count or not.\\nHe said. &ldquo;We have all seen the report of INEC on Rivers State and others. It is obvious that the military have been sharing powers with the President. If this is not true, how can the military be the one to determine which results would be allowed into the collation centres?\\n&ldquo;The military have abandoned their constitutional roles of defending the territorial integrity of the nation. They have become an arm of a political party. This is dangerous for the nation. &ldquo;The military are helping the ruling party to kill the opposition in order to have a one party state. If that is allowed, then we may not have democracy again but a one party state. That are shameful and unacceptable.\\nSpeaking further, he said &ldquo;The military are the one determining which state election is to be declared inconclusive with their actions, adding that \"democracy without opposition is no longer a government of the people by the people. Rather, it is a dictatorship government.
