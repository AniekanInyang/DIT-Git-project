#  1. What is the difference in the implementation of the Bayes and Na√Øve Bayes model
#Ans:
#   the difference is that while Naives bayes uses variance in it's implementation Bayes
#   uses full covariance matrix which significantly improves training score compare to Naive baye's
#   in the fit function, we calculate and stored the covariance instaed of the variance in naive baye's
#   the covariance is then passed into the predict function in place of the variance
