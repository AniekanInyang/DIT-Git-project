#  1. What is the difference in the implementation of the Bayes and Na√Øve Bayes model

Ans:
   the difference is that while Naives bayes uses variance in it's implementation Bayes
   uses full covariance matrix which significantly improves training score compare to Naive baye's.
   in the fit function, we calculate and stored the covariance instaed of the variance in naive baye's
   the covariance is then passed into the predict function in place of the variance

 9. Why did you choose your learning rate and epochs?

 Ans: the learning rate helps in achieving a perfect classification rate of 1.0, but in which i got 0.8 
      and i choose epochs of 240 as we have to split our data

10. What can you do to increase train and test accuracy?

Ans: by making the best use of our hyperparameters like like the learning rate, bias term and
     also ensuring all null values are properly taken care of and finally ensuring
     all input features in different columns does not outweights others which can
     result to overfitting which will enventually affect our output.
