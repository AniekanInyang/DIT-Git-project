the difference between bayes and naive bayes model:

1. Bayes model assumes that the events are conditional and dependent
while Naive bayes model assumes that the events are independent

2. Naive bayes model uses "smoothing" to avoid the problem of having Zero
while Bayes model does not make use of smoothing

3.  bayes model uses covariance while naive bayes model uses variance
